  abstract: Experimental particle physics seeks to understand the universe by probing its fundamental particles and forces and exploring how they govern the large-scale processes that shape cosmic evolution. This whitepaper presents a vision for how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can accelerate discovery in this field. We outline grand challenges that must be addressed to enable transformative breakthroughs and describe how current and planned experimental facilities can implement this vision to advance our understanding of the vast and complex physical world from the smallest to the largest scales. We show how facilities currently under construction, such as the HL-LHC, DUNE and soon EIC, can both benefit from and serve as proving grounds for this vision, while also enabling a longer-term goal for how future experiments -- like FCC-ee at CERN, IceCube-Gen2, a Muon Collider in the U.S., and smaller to mid-scale projects -- can be fully AI-native. We describe how a truly national-scale collaboration, jointly managed across large funding partners, and involving both DOE laboratories and universities, can make this happen.

  abstract: This paper presents the first demonstration of a viable, ultra-fast, radiation-hard machine learning (ML) application on FPGAs, which could be used in future high-energy physics experiments. We present a three-fold contribution, with the PicoCal calorimeter, planned for the LHCb Upgrade II experiment, used as a test case. First, we develop a lightweight autoencoder to compress a 32-sample timing readout, representative of that of the PicoCal, into a two-dimensional latent space. Second, we introduce a systematic, hardware-aware quantization strategy and show that the model can be reduced to 10-bit weights with minimal performance loss. Third, as a barrier to the adoption of on-detector ML is the lack of support for radiation-hard FPGAs in the High-Energy Physics community's standard ML synthesis tool, hls4ml, we develop a new backend for this library. This new back-end enables the automatic translation of ML models into High-Level Synthesis (HLS) projects for the Microchip PolarFire family of FPGAs, one of the few commercially available and radiation hard FPGAs. We present the synthesis of the autoencoder on a target PolarFire FPGA, which indicates that a latency of 25 ns can be achieved. We show that the resources utilized are low enough that the model can be placed within the inherently protected logic of the FPGA. Our extension to hls4ml is a significant contribution, paving the way for broader adoption of ML on FPGAs in high-radiation environments.

  abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has established that scaling compute, through joint increases in model capacity and dataset size, is the primary driver of performance in modern machine learning. While machine learning has long been an integral component of High Energy Physics (HEP) data analysis workflows, the compute used to train state-of-the-art HEP models remains orders of magnitude below that of industry foundation models. With scaling laws only beginning to be studied in the field, we investigate neural scaling laws for boosted jet classification using the public JetClass dataset. We derive compute optimal scaling laws and identify an effective performance limit that can be consistently approached through increased compute. We study how data repetition, common in HEP where simulation is expensive, modifies the scaling yielding a quantifiable effective dataset size gain. We then study how the scaling coefficients and asymptotic performance limits vary with the choice of input features and particle multiplicity, demonstrating that increased compute reliably drives performance toward an asymptotic limit, and that more expressive, lower-level features can raise the performance limit and improve results at fixed dataset size.

  abstract: Next-generation GW observatories such as the ET and CE will detect BNS and NSBH inspirals with high SNRs and long in-band durations, making systematic early-warning alerts both feasible and scientifically valuable. Such triggers are essential for coordinating rapid electromagnetic follow-up. In this work, we introduce GW-FALCON, a novel feature-driven DL framework for early-time detection between GW signal+noise and noise-only data in next-generation detectors. Instead of feeding raw time series to CNN or more complex neural network architectures, we first extract a large set of statistical, temporal, and spectral quantities from short observational time windows using the TSFEL library. The resulting fixed-length feature vectors are then used as input to feed-forward ANNs suitable for low-latency operation. We demonstrate the method using simulated BNS and NSBH inspiral waveforms injected into colored Gaussian noise generated from the ET and CE design PSDs. We train separate ANNs on feature sets extracted from partial-inspiral windows characterized by different maximum instantaneous frequencies, enabling early-warning triggers from tens to hundreds of seconds before merger. Across all detector configurations and datasets, the resulting classifiers achieve high accuracy and detection efficiency, with ET-like networks typically reaching test accuracies of order 90% and CE-like ones exceeding 97% at low false-alarm probability. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first comprehensive feature-based DL detection framework for Next-generation GW observatories, connecting feature extraction from strain time series data to robust signal-noise classification within a setup that can be extended to real data and to more advanced neural network architectures.

  abstract: MadSpace is a new modular phase-space and event-generation library written in C++ with native GPU support via CUDA and HIP. It provides a unified compute-graph-based framework for phase-space construction, adaptive and neural importance sampling, and event unweighting. It includes a wide range of mappings, from the standard MadGraph multi-channel phase space to optimized normalizing flows with analytic inverse transformations. All components operate on batches of events and support end-to-end on-device workflows. A high-level Python interface enables seamless integration with machine-learning libraries such as PyTorch.

  abstract: Principled Bayesian inference of galaxy properties has not previously been performed for wide-area weak lensing surveys with millions of sources. We address this gap by applying the pop-cosmos generative model to perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting for 4 million KiDS-1000 galaxies. Calibrated on deep COSMOS2020 photometric data, pop-cosmos specifies a physically-motivated prior over the galaxy population up to $z \simeq 6$ in stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameter space. Using the Speculator SPS emulator with GPU-accelerated MCMC sampling, we perform full posterior inference at 6.5 GPU seconds per galaxy, obtaining joint constraints on galaxy redshifts and physical properties. We validate photometric redshifts against $\sim\!185,\!000$ KiDS galaxies cross-matched to DESI DR1 spectroscopic samples, achieving low bias ($3\times10^{-3}$), scatter ($σ_{\mathrm{MAD}}=0.04$), and outlier fraction (3.7%) for the Bright Galaxy Survey, with comparable performance (bias $3\times10^{-2}$, $σ_{\mathrm{MAD}}=0.05$, 1.3% outliers) for luminous red galaxies (LRGs). Within the LRG sample, we identify massive, dusty, star-forming contaminants at $z \simeq 0.4$ satisfying standard colour selections for quenched populations. We infer trends in stellar mass, star formation, metallicity, and dust across five tomographic redshift bins consistent with established scaling relations. Using specific star formation rate constraints, we identify $\sim$10% of KiDS-1000 galaxies as quenched, versus 37% implied by conservative colour cuts. This enables the construction of weak lensing samples defined by physical properties while mitigating intrinsic alignment systematics and preserving statistical power. Our analysis validates pop-cosmos out-of-sample, establishing it as a scaleable approach for galaxy evolution and cosmological analyses in photometric surveys.

  abstract: "The accuracy of the cosmological constraints from Stage~IV galaxy surveys will be limited by how well the galaxy redshift distributions can be inferred. We have addressed this challenging problem for the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) cosmic shear sample by developing a forward-modeling framework with two main ingredients: (1) the \\texttt{pop-cosmos} generative model for the evolving galaxy population, calibrated on \\textit{Spitzer} IRAC $\\textit{Ch.\\,1}<26$ galaxies from COSMOS2020; and (2) a data model for noise and selection, machine-learned from the SURFS-based KiDS-Legacy-Like Simulations (SKiLLS). Applying KiDS tomographic binning to our synthetic photometric data, we infer redshift distributions in each of five bins directly from the population and data models, bypassing the need for spectroscopic reweighting. Keeping the data model fixed, we compare results using two different galaxy population models: \\texttt{pop-cosmos}; and \\texttt{shark}, the semi-analytic galaxy formation model used in SKiLLS. In the first ($0.1<z<0.3$) and last ($0.9<z<1.2$) tomographic bins we find systematic differences in the mean redshifts of $Δz\\sim0.05$-$0.1$, comparable to the reported uncertainties from spectroscopic reweighting methods. This work paves the way for accurate redshift distribution calibration for Stage~IV surveys directly through forward modeling, thus providing an independent cross-check on spectroscopic-based calibrations which avoids their selection biases and incompleteness. We will use the \\texttt{pop-cosmos} redshift distributions in an upcoming full KiDS cosmology reanalysis."

  abstract: Symmetries play a central role in physics, organizing dynamics, constraining interactions, and determining the effective number of physical degrees of freedom. In parallel, modern artificial intelligence methods have demonstrated a remarkable ability to extract low-dimensional structure from high-dimensional data through representation learning. This review examines the interplay between these two perspectives, focusing on the extent to which symmetry-induced constraints can be identified, encoded, or diagnosed using machine learning techniques. Rather than emphasizing architectures that enforce known symmetries by construction, we concentrate on data-driven approaches and latent representation learning, with particular attention to variational autoencoders. We discuss how symmetries and conservation laws reduce the intrinsic dimensionality of physical datasets, and how this reduction may manifest itself through self-organization of latent spaces in generative models trained to balance reconstruction and compression. We review recent results, including case studies from simple geometric systems and particle physics processes, and analyze the theoretical and practical limitations of inferring symmetry structure without explicit inductive bias.

  abstract: A search is performed for a heavy scalar resonance X decaying to a Higgs boson (H) and a Higgs-like scalar boson (Y) in the two bottom quark (H $\to$$\mathrm{b\bar{b}}$) and four quark (Y $\to$ VV $\to$ 4q) final state, where V denotes a W or Z boson. Masses of the X between 900 and 4000 GeV and the Y between 60 and 2800 GeV are considered. The search is performed in data collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC from proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV center-of-mass energy, with a data set corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. It targets the Lorentz-boosted regime, in which the products of the H $\to$$\mathrm{b\bar{b}}$ decay can be reconstructed as a single large-area jet, and those from the Y $\to$ VV $\to$ 4q decay as either one Y $\to$ 4q or two V to $\mathrm{q\bar{q}}$ jets. Jet identification and mass reconstruction exploit machine-learning tools, including a novel attention-based "particle transformer" for Y $\to$ 4q identification. No significant excess is observed in the data above the standard model background expectation. Upper limits on the product of production cross section and branching fraction as low as 0.2 fb are derived at 95% confidence level for various mass hypotheses. This is the first search at the LHC for scalar resonances in the all-hadronic $\mathrm{b\bar{b}}$VV decay channel.

  abstract: We demonstrate that gauge equivariant diffusion models can accurately model the physics of non-Abelian lattice gauge theory using the Metropolis-adjusted annealed Langevin algorithm (MAALA), as exemplified by computations in two-dimensional U(2) and SU(2) gauge theories. Our network architecture is based on lattice gauge equivariant convolutional neural networks (L-CNNs), which respect local and global symmetries on the lattice. Models are trained on a single ensemble generated using a traditional Monte Carlo method. By studying Wilson loops of various size as well as the topological susceptibility, we find that the diffusion approach generalizes remarkably well to larger inverse couplings and lattice sizes with negligible loss of accuracy while retaining moderately high acceptance rates.

  abstract: Cross-correlations between 21cm observations and galaxy surveys provide a powerful probe of reionization by reducing foreground sensitivity while linking ionization morphology to galaxies. We quantify the constraining power of 21cm-Galaxy cross-power spectra for inferring neutral hydrogen fraction $x_\mathrm{HI}(z)$ and mean overdensity $\langle 1+δ_\mathrm{HI} \rangle(z)$, exploring dependence on field of view, redshift precision $σ_z$, and minimum halo mass $M_\mathrm{h,min}$. We employ our simulation-based inference framework EoRFlow for likelihood-free parameter estimation. Mock observations include thermal noise for 100h SKA-Low with foreground avoidance and realistic galaxy survey effects. For a fiducial survey ($\mathrm{FOV}=100\,\mathrm{deg}^2$, $σ_z=0.001$, $M_\mathrm{h,min}=10^{11}\mathrm{M}_\odot$), cross-power spectra yield unbiased constraints with posterior volumes (PV) of $\sim$10% relative to priors. Cross-power measurements reduce PV by 20-30% versus 21cm auto-power alone. With foreground avoidance, spectroscopic redshift precision is essential; photometric redshifts render cross-correlations uninformative. Notably, cross-power spectra constrain ionizing source properties, the escape fraction $f_\mathrm{esc}$ and star formation efficiency $f_*$, which remain degenerate in auto-power (PV $>$60%). Tight constraints require either deep surveys detecting faint galaxies ($M_\mathrm{h,min} \sim 10^{10}\mathrm{M}_\odot$) with moderate foregrounds, or conservative mass limits with optimistic foreground removal (PV $<$15%). 21cm-Galaxy cross-correlations enhance morphology constraints beyond auto-power while enabling previously inaccessible source property constraints. Realizing full potential requires precise redshifts and either faint galaxy detection limits or improved 21cm foreground cleaning.

  abstract: Gauge-mediated supersymmetry-breaking models provide a strong motivation to search for a supersymmetric partner of the tau lepton (stau) with a macroscopic lifetime. Long-lived stau decays produce tau leptons that are displaced from the primary proton-proton interaction vertex, leading to an unconventional signature. This paper presents a search for the direct production of long-lived staus decaying within the CMS tracker volume in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, performed for the first time with an identification algorithm based on a graph neural network dedicated to displaced tau leptons. The data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$, was recorded with the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC between 2016 and 2018. This search excludes, at 95% confidence level, stau masses, $m_\tildeτ$, in the 126$-$260 (906$-$425) GeV range for a proper decay length of 50 mm in the maximally mixed (mass-degenerate) scenario, while for $m_\tildeτ $ = 200 GeV, stau proper decay lengths are excluded in the range 21$-$94 (6$-$333) mm. These results improve the exclusion limits compared to previous searches, and extend the parameter space explored in the context of supersymmetry.

  abstract: "Two machine learning techniques for jet measurements at the LHCb experiment are presented: a regression-based method for jet-energy calibration and a deep neural network algorithm for jet flavour tagging, distinguishing between $b$-quark, $c$-quark, and light parton jets. These techniques are applied to a search for inclusive $H \\to \\bbbar$ and $H \\to c\\barcc$ decays using a LHCb dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.6\\invfb. The observed (expected) 95% confidence level upper limits correspond to 6.6 (11.1) times the SM cross-section for the $H \\to b\\bar b$ process, and 1003 (1834) times the SM cross-section for the $H \\to c\\bar c$ process."

  abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will produce unprecedented volumes of heterogeneous astronomical data (images, catalogs, and alerts) that challenge traditional analysis pipelines. The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) aims to derive robust constraints on dark energy and dark matter from these data, requiring methods that are statistically powerful, scalable, and operationally reliable. Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) are already embedded across DESC science workflows, from photometric redshifts and transient classification to weak lensing inference and cosmological simulations. Yet their utility for precision cosmology hinges on trustworthy uncertainty quantification, robustness to covariate shift and model misspecification, and reproducible integration within scientific pipelines. This white paper surveys the current landscape of AI/ML across DESC's primary cosmological probes and cross-cutting analyses, revealing that the same core methodologies and fundamental challenges recur across disparate science cases. Since progress on these cross-cutting challenges would benefit multiple probes simultaneously, we identify key methodological research priorities, including Bayesian inference at scale, physics-informed methods, validation frameworks, and active learning for discovery. With an eye on emerging techniques, we also explore the potential of the latest foundation model methodologies and LLM-driven agentic AI systems to reshape DESC workflows, provided their deployment is coupled with rigorous evaluation and governance. Finally, we discuss critical software, computing, data infrastructure, and human capital requirements for the successful deployment of these new methodologies, and consider associated risks and opportunities for broader coordination with external actors.

  abstract: We demonstrate the capabilities of probabilistic diffusion models to reduce dramatically the computational cost of expensive hydrodynamical simulations to study the relationship between observable baryonic cosmological probes and dark matter at field level and well into the non-linear regime. We introduce a novel technique, Cosmo-FOLD (Cosmological Fields via Overlap Latent Diffusion) to rapidly generate accurate and arbitrarily large cosmological and astrophysical 3-dimensional fields, conditioned on a given input field. We are able to generate TNG300-2 dark matter density and gas temperature fields from a model trained only on ~1% of the volume (a process we refer to as `upscaling'), reproducing both large scale coherent dark matter filaments and power spectra to within 10% for wavenumbers k <= 5 h Mpc^-1. These results are obtained within a small fraction of the original simulation cost and produced on a single GPU. Beyond one and two points statistics, the bispectrum is also faithfully reproduced through the inclusion of positional encodings. Finally, we demonstrate Cosmo-FOLD's generalisation capabilities by upscaling a CAMELS volume of 25 (Mpc h^-1)^3 to a full TNG300-2 volume of 205 (Mpc h^-1)^3$ with no fine-tuning. Cosmo-FOLD opens the door to full field-level simulation-based inference on cosmological scale.

  abstract: Scaling laws describing the dependence of neural network performance on the amount of training data, the spent compute, and the network size have emerged across a huge variety of machine learning task and datasets. In this work, we systematically investigate these scaling laws in the context of amplitude surrogates for particle physics. We show that the scaling coefficients are connected to the number of external particles of the process. Our results demonstrate that scaling laws are a useful tool to achieve desired precision targets.

  abstract: Accurate and efficient detector simulation is essential for modern collider experiments. To reduce the high computational cost, various fast machine learning surrogate models have been proposed. Traditional surrogate models for calorimeter shower modeling train separate networks for each particle species, limiting scalability and reuse. We introduce AllShowers, a unified generative model that simulates calorimeter showers across multiple particle types using a single generative model. AllShowers is a continuous normalizing flow model with a Transformer architecture, enabling it to generate complex spatial and energy correlations in variable-length point cloud representations of showers. Trained on a diverse dataset of simulated showers in the highly granular ILD detector, the model demonstrates the ability to generate realistic showers for electrons, photons, and charged and neutral hadrons across a wide range of incident energies and angles without retraining. In addition to unifying shower generation for multiple particle types, AllShowers surpasses the fidelity of previous single-particle-type models for hadronic showers. Key innovations include the use of a layer embedding, allowing the model to learn all relevant calorimeter layer properties; a custom attention masking scheme to reduce computational demands and introduce a helpful inductive bias; and a shower- and layer-wise optimal transport mapping to improve training convergence and sample quality. AllShowers marks a significant step towards a universal model for calorimeter shower simulations in collider experiments.

  abstract: "A key challenge in designing normalizing flows is finding expressive scalar bijections that remain invertible with tractable Jacobians. Existing approaches face trade-offs: affine transformations are smooth and analytically invertible but lack expressivity; monotonic splines offer local control but are only piecewise smooth and act on bounded domains; residual flows achieve smoothness but need numerical inversion. We introduce three families of analytic bijections -- cubic rational, sinh, and cubic polynomial -- that are globally smooth ($C^\\infty$), defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, and analytically invertible in closed form, combining the favorable properties of all prior approaches. These bijections serve as drop-in replacements in coupling flows, matching or exceeding spline performance. Beyond coupling layers, we develop radial flows: a novel architecture using direct parametrization that transforms the radial coordinate while preserving angular direction. Radial flows exhibit exceptional training stability, produce geometrically interpretable transformations, and on targets with radial structure can achieve comparable quality to coupling flows with $1000\\times$ fewer parameters. We provide comprehensive evaluation on 1D and 2D benchmarks, and demonstrate applicability to higher-dimensional physics problems through experiments on $ϕ^4$ lattice field theory, where our bijections outperform affine baselines and enable problem-specific designs that address mode collapse."

  abstract: We present a systematic study of Tensor Network (TN) models $\unicode{x2013}$ Matrix Product States (MPS) and Tree Tensor Networks (TTN) $\unicode{x2013}$ for real-time jet tagging in high-energy physics, with a focus on low-latency deployment on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Motivated by the strict requirements of the HL-LHC Level-1 trigger system, we explore TNs as compact and interpretable alternatives to deep neural networks. Using low-level jet constituent features, our models achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers. We investigate post-training quantization to enable hardware-efficient implementations without degrading classification performance or latency. The best-performing models are synthesized to estimate FPGA resource usage, latency, and memory occupancy, demonstrating sub-microsecond latency and supporting the feasibility of online deployment in real-time trigger systems. Overall, this study highlights the potential of TN-based models for fast and resource-efficient inference in low-latency environments.

  abstract: This whitepaper surveys the current landscape and short- to mid-term prospects for quantum-enabled optimization and machine learning use cases in industrial settings. Grounded in the QCHALLenge program, it synthesizes hardware trajectories from different quantum architectures and providers, and assesses their maturity and potential for real-world use cases under a standardized traffic-light evaluation framework. We provide a concise summary of relevant hardware roadmaps, distinguishing superconducting and ion-trap technologies, their current states, modalities, and projected scaling trajectories. The core of the presented work are the use case evaluations in the domains of optimization problems and machine learning applications. For the conducted experiments, we apply a consistent set of evaluation criteria (model formulation, scalability, solution quality, runtime, and transferability) which are assessed in a shared system of three categories, ranging from optimistic (solutions produced by quantum computers are competitive with classical methods and/or a clear path to a quantum advantage is shown) to pessimistic (significant hurdles prevent practical application of quantum solutions now and potentially in the future). The resulting verdicts illuminate where quantum approaches currently offer promise, where hybrid classical-quantum strategies are most viable, and where classical methods are expected to remain superior.

  abstract: A machine-learning-based framework for constructing generator-level observables optimized for parameter extraction in particle physics analyses is introduced, referred to as the Optimal Observable Machine (OOM). Unfoldable differential distributions are learned that maximize sensitivity to a parameter of interest while remaining robust against detector effects, systematic uncertainties, and biases introduced by the unfolding procedure. Detector response and systematic uncertainties are explicitly incorporated into the training through a likelihood-based loss function, enabling a direct optimization of the expected measurement precision while minimizing the bias from any assumption on the parameter of interest itself. The approach is demonstrated in an application to top quark physics, focusing on the measurement of a recently observed pseudoscalar excess at the top quark pair production threshold in dilepton final states. It is shown that a generator-level observable with enhanced sensitivity and long-term reinterpretability can be constructed using this method.

  abstract: "We study the use of large language models (LLMs) for physics instrument design and compare their performance to reinforcement learning (RL). Using only prompting, LLMs are given task constraints and summaries of prior high-scoring designs and propose complete detector configurations, which we evaluate with the same simulators and reward functions used in RL-based optimization. Although RL yields stronger final designs, we find that modern LLMs consistently generate valid, resource-aware, and physically meaningful configurations that draw on broad pretrained knowledge of detector design principles and particle--matter interactions, despite having no task-specific training. Based on this result, as a first step toward hybrid design workflows, we explore pairing the LLMs with a dedicated trust region optimizer, serving as a precursor to future pipelines in which LLMs propose and structure design hypotheses while RL performs reward-driven optimization. Based on these experiments, we argue that LLMs are well suited as meta-planners: they can design and orchestrate RL-based optimization studies, define search strategies, and coordinate multiple interacting components within a unified workflow. In doing so, they point toward automated, closed-loop instrument design in which much of the human effort required to structure and supervise optimization can be reduced."

  abstract: In this work, we present a conditional denoising-diffusion surrogate for electromagnetic calorimeter showers that is trained to generate high-fidelity energy-deposition maps conditioned on key detector and beam parameters. The model employs efficient inference using Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model sampling and is pre-trained on GEANT4 simulations before being adapted to a new calorimeter geometry through Low-Rank Adaptation, requiring only a small post-training dataset. We evaluate physically meaningful observables, including total deposited energy, energy-weighted radius, and shower dispersion, obtaining relative root mean square error values below 2% for representative high-energy cases. This is in line with state-of-the-art calorimeter surrogates which report comparable fidelity on high-level observables. Furthermore, we compare gradients of a reconstruction-based utility function with respect to design parameters between the surrogate and finite-difference references. The diffusion surrogate reproduces the qualitative structure and directional trends of the true utility landscape, providing usable sensitivities for gradient-based optimization. These results show that diffusion-based surrogates can accelerate simulation-driven detector design while enabling differentiable, gradient-informed analysis.

  abstract: A search is conducted for standard model Higgs bosons with large transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) decaying to bottom quark pairs and produced in association with a hadronically decaying W or Z boson at the LHC. The result is based on a dataset of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector in 2016$-$2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. Boosted Higgs, W, and Z boson decays are reconstructed using large-radius jets with $p_\mathrm{T}$$\gt$ 450 GeV and identified with heavy-flavor classifiers based on a graph convolutional neural network. The observed signal strength relative to the standard model expectation is $μ$ = 0.7$2^{+0.75}_{-0.71}$ including statistical and systematic uncertainties.

  abstract: Anomaly detection methods used in a recent search for new phenomena by CMS at the CERN LHC are presented. The methods use machine learning to detect anomalous jets produced in the decay of new massive particles. The effectiveness of these approaches in enhancing sensitivity to various signals is studied and compared using data collected in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. In an example analysis, the capabilities of anomaly detection methods are further demonstrated by identifying large-radius jets consistent with Lorentz-boosted hadronically decaying top quarks in a model-agnostic framework.

  abstract: Modern machine learning is transforming jet tagging at the LHC, but the leading transformer architectures are large, not particularly fast, and training-intensive. We present a slim version of the L-GATr tagger, reduce the number of parameters of jet-tagging transformers, and quantize them. We compare different quantization methods for standard and Lorentz-equivariant transformers and estimate their gains in resource efficiency. We find an order-of-magnitude reduction in energy cost for an moderate performance decrease, down to 1000-parameter taggers. This might be a step towards trigger-level jet tagging with small and quantized versions of the leading equivariant transformer architectures.

  abstract: We introduce ColliderML - a large, open, experiment-agnostic dataset of fully simulated and digitised proton-proton collisions in High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider conditions ($\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV, mean pile-up $μ= 200$). ColliderML provides one million events across ten Standard Model and Beyond Standard Model processes, plus extensive single-particle samples, all produced with modern next-to-leading order matrix element calculation and showering, realistic per-event pile-up overlay, a validated OpenDataDetector geometry, and standard reconstructions. The release fills a major gap for machine learning (ML) research on detector-level data, provided on the ML-friendly Hugging Face platform. We present physics coverage and the generation, simulation, digitisation and reconstruction pipeline, describe format and access, and initial collider physics benchmarks.

  abstract: In this work, we review the history and current role of global fits in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model~(BSM), including precision tests of the Standard Model (SM). Although BSM global fits were initially focused on minimal supersymmetric models, we describe how fits have evolved in response to new data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and elsewhere, expanding to encompass a broad spectrum of BSM scenarios including non-minimal supersymmetry, axion-like particles, extended Higgs sectors, dark matter models, and effective field theories such as SMEFT. We discuss how the role of global fits has shifted from forecasting possible signals of new physics at the LHC to understanding the impact of null results from LHC run-I and II and the discovery of the Higgs boson, and how interest has shifted from global fits for parameter estimation to comprehensive model comparison. We close by discussing potential trends and future applications, emphasizing the potential for machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance the efficiency of sampling algorithms and comparison between theory and experiment, as well as collaboration and software development.

  abstract: Accurate and efficient amplitude predictions are essential for precision studies of multi-jet processes at the LHC. We introduce a novel neural network architecture that predicts multi-jet amplitudes by leveraging the Catani-Seymour factorization scheme and related lower-jet amplitudes, requiring the network to learn only a correction factor. This hybrid approach combines theoretical factorization with a data-driven ansatz, enabling fast and scalable amplitude predictions. Our networks also estimate the accuracy of each prediction, allowing us to selectively use results that meet a predefined accuracy threshold. In the context of leading-order event generation, this approach achieves speed-up factors of up to 20 while maintaining all observables at the percent-level accuracy.

  abstract: We present PolySwyft, a novel, non-amortised simulation-based inference framework that unites the strengths of nested sampling (NS) and neural ratio estimation (NRE) to tackle challenging posterior distributions when the likelihood is intractable but a forward simulator is available. By nesting rounds of NRE within the exploration of NS, and employing a principled KL-divergence criterion to adaptively terminate sampling, PolySwyft achieves faster convergence on complex, multimodal targets while rigorously preserving Bayesian validity. On a suite of toy problems with analytically known posteriors of a dim(theta,D)=(5,100) multivariate Gaussian and multivariate correlated Gaussian mixture model, we demonstrate that PolySwyft recovers all modes and credible regions with fewer simulator calls than swyft's TNRE. As a real-world application, we infer cosmological parameters dim(theta,D)=(6,111) from CMB power spectra using CosmoPower. PolySwyft is released as open-source software, offering a flexible toolkit for efficient, accurate inference across the astrophysical sciences and beyond.

  abstract: Modern radio interferometers deliver large volumes of data containing high-sensitivity sky maps over wide fields-of-view. These large area observations can contain various and superposed structures such as point sources, extended objects, and large-scale diffuse emission. To fully realize the potential of these observations, it is crucial to build appropriate sky emission models which separate and reconstruct the underlying astrophysical components. We introduce aim-resolve, an automatic and iterative method that combines the Bayesian imaging algorithm resolve with deep learning and clustering algorithms in order to jointly solve the reconstruction and source extraction problem. The method identifies and models different astrophysical components in radio observations while providing uncertainty quantification of the results. By using different model descriptions for point sources, extended objects, and diffuse background emission, the method efficiently separates the individual components and improves the overall reconstruction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on synthetic image data containing multiple different sources. We further show the application of aim-resolve to an L-band (856 - 1712 MHz) MeerKAT observation of the radio galaxy ESO 137-006 and other radio galaxies in that environment. We observe a reasonable object identification for both applications, yielding a clean separation of the individual components and precise reconstructions of point sources and extended objects along with detailed uncertainty quantification. In particular, the method enables the creation of catalogs containing source positions and brightnesses and the corresponding uncertainties. The full decoupling of sky emission model and instrument response makes the method applicable to a wide variety of instruments or wavelength bands.

  abstract: "A deep-learning approach based on the transformer architecture is developed to distinguish between jets originating from quarks and gluons. The algorithm operates on jets with transverse momentum $p_{\\text{T}} > 20$ and pseudorapidity $|η| < 4.5$ and takes as input several properties derived from the jet constituents, using information from the ATLAS detector's tracker and calorimeter. The algorithm's performance is evaluated by analyzing dijet data events from proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ and $13.6$ TeV during Run 2 and Run 3 of the Large Hadron Collider. Two methods are used to obtain distributions from quark- or gluon-initiated jets in data: a matrix method fully based on Monte Carlo simulation and a new approach named `jet topics' which has less dependence on the modelling of the physics process under study. The quark and gluon identification efficiencies measured in data for the 50% quark-identification-efficiency working point vary from the simulated ones for quark-initiated (gluon-initiated) jets by factors of 0.88-1.30 (0.61-1.05) with uncertainties of 10%-70% (10%-95%). The uncertainties estimated with the jet topics method are smaller than those estimated with the matrix method, with up to 20% less systematic uncertainty in some phase-space regions. The advances in jet identification reported here provide a robust tool for precision Standard Model measurements and searches for new physics at the LHC."

  abstract: Next token prediction is an attractive pre-training task for jet foundation models, in that it is simulation free and enables excellent generative capabilities that can transfer across datasets. Here we study multiple improvements to next token prediction, building on the initial work of OmniJet-$α$. Instead of tokenizing particles and subsequently only using the token-ID as the model input for both the generative and the classification task, we adopt a hybrid setup, which allows us to use continuous feature vectors as model input while only using token-IDs in the next token prediction target. Secondly, we explore a combined pre-training strategy that combines masked particle modeling and generative learning objectives. Taken together, these changes greatly improve the performance in downstream classification tasks without any loss in generative performance.

  abstract: Gravitational-wave data analysis relies on accurate and efficient methods to extract physical information from noisy detector signals, yet the increasing rate and complexity of observations represent a growing challenge. Deep learning provides a powerful alternative to traditional inference, but existing neural models typically lack the flexibility to handle variations in data analysis settings. Such variations accommodate imperfect observations or are required for specialized tests, and could include changes in detector configurations, overall frequency ranges, or localized cuts. We introduce a flexible transformer-based architecture paired with a training strategy that enables adaptation to diverse analysis settings at inference time. Applied to parameter estimation, we demonstrate that a single flexible model -- called Dingo-T1 -- can (i) analyze 48 gravitational-wave events from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Observing Run under a wide range of analysis configurations, (ii) enable systematic studies of how detector and frequency configurations impact inferred posteriors, and (iii) perform inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency tests probing general relativity. Dingo-T1 also improves median sample efficiency on real events from a baseline of 1.4% to 4.2%. Our approach thus demonstrates flexible and scalable inference with a principled framework for handling missing or incomplete data -- key capabilities for current and next-generation observatories.

  abstract: We present hls4ml, a free and open-source platform that translates machine learning (ML) models from modern deep learning frameworks into high-level synthesis (HLS) code that can be integrated into full designs for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) or application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). With its flexible and modular design, hls4ml supports a large number of deep learning frameworks and can target HLS compilers from several vendors, including Vitis HLS, Intel oneAPI and Catapult HLS. Together with a wider eco-system for software-hardware co-design, hls4ml has enabled the acceleration of ML inference in a wide range of commercial and scientific applications where low latency, resource usage, and power consumption are critical. In this paper, we describe the structure and functionality of the hls4ml platform. The overarching design considerations for the generated HLS code are discussed, together with selected performance results.

  abstract: "Data sets that are specified by a large number of features are currently outside the area of applicability for quantum machine learning algorithms. An immediate solution to this impasse is the application of dimensionality reduction methods before passing the data to the quantum algorithm. We investigate six conventional feature extraction algorithms and five autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction models to a particle physics data set with 67 features. The reduced representations generated by these models are then used to train a quantum support vector machine for solving a binary classification problem: whether a Higgs boson is produced in proton collisions at the LHC. We show that the autoencoder methods learn a better lower-dimensional representation of the data, with the method we design, the Sinkclass autoencoder, performing 40% better than the baseline. The methods developed here open up the applicability of quantum machine learning to a larger array of data sets. Moreover, we provide a recipe for effective dimensionality reduction in this context."

  abstract: Accurate particle shower simulation remains a critical computational bottleneck for high-energy physics. Traditional Monte Carlo methods, such as Geant4, are computationally prohibitive, while existing machine learning surrogates are tied to specific detector geometries and require complete retraining for each design change or alternative detector. We present a transfer learning framework for generative calorimeter simulation models that enables adaptation across diverse geometries with high data efficiency. Using point cloud representations and pre-training on the International Large Detector detector, our approach handles new configurations without re-voxelizing showers for each geometry. On the CaloChallenge dataset, transfer learning with only 100 target-domain samples achieves a $44\%$ improvement on the geometric mean of Wasserstein distance over training from scratch. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning with bias-only adaptation achieves competitive performance while updating only $17\%$ of model parameters. Our analysis provides insight into adaptation mechanisms for particle shower development, establishing a baseline for future progress of point cloud approaches in calorimeter simulation.

  abstract: This paper presents two searches for the electroweak production of higgsinos with compressed mass spectra using 140 fb$^{-1}$ of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Events are required to feature an energetic jet, large missing transverse momentum, and at least one low-momentum charged particle that serves as a candidate higgsino decay product. In the first search, targeting higgsino mass splittings in the range of 0.3-1 GeV, the higgsinos are expected to predominantly decay into pions that are identified as low-momentum charged particles with large transverse impact parameters due to the long higgsino lifetime ($cτ\approx\mathcal{O}$(0.1-1 mm)). The second search targets larger mass splittings in the range of 1-3 GeV, where the higgsinos are expected to decay promptly into low-momentum leptons, one of which is identified by dedicated low-momentum electron or muon taggers based on neural networks utilising tracking and calorimeter information. No significant excess above the Standard Model prediction is observed in either search and the results are used to set lower limits on the masses of the higgsino-like charginos and neutralinos within a simplified model. Together, these searches exclude chargino masses below 126 GeV at 95% confidence level for mass splittings between the chargino and lightest neutralino in the range of 0.3-2 GeV, representing the first ATLAS constraints in this parameter space and surpassing the limits previously set by the LEP experiments.

  abstract: The physics programs of current and future collider experiments necessitate the development of surrogate simulators for calorimeter showers. While much progress has been made in the development of generative models for this task, they have typically been evaluated in simplified scenarios and for single particles. This is particularly true for the challenging task of highly granular calorimeter simulation. For the first time, this work studies the use of highly granular generative calorimeter surrogates in a realistic simulation application. We introduce DDML, a generic library which enables the combination of generative calorimeter surrogates with realistic detectors implemented using the DD4hep toolkit. We compare two different generative models - one operating on a regular grid representation, and the other using a less common point cloud approach. In order to disentangle methodological details from model performance, we provide comparisons to idealized simulators which directly sample representations of different resolutions from the full simulation ground-truth. We then systematically evaluate model performance on post-reconstruction benchmarks for electromagnetic shower simulation. Beginning with a typical single particle study, we introduce a first multi-particle benchmark based on di-photon separations, before studying a first full-physics benchmark based on hadronic decays of the tau lepton. Our results indicate that models operating on a point cloud can achieve a favorable balance between speed and accuracy for highly granular calorimeter simulation compared to those which operate on a regular grid representation.

  abstract: We present the $N$-fit algorithm designed to improve the reconstruction of neutrino events detected by a single line of the ANTARES underwater telescope, usually associated with low energy neutrino events ($\sim$ 100 GeV). $N$-Fit is a neural network model that relies on deep learning and combines several advanced techniques in machine learning --deep convolutional layers, mixture density output layers, and transfer learning. This framework divides the reconstruction process into two dedicated branches for each neutrino event topology --tracks and showers-- composed of sub-models for spatial estimation --direction and position-- and energy inference, which later on are combined for event classification. Regarding the direction of single-line events, the $N$-Fit algorithm significantly refines the estimation of the zenithal angle, and delivers reliable azimuthal angle predictions that were previously unattainable with traditional $χ^2$-fit methods. Improving on energy estimation of single-line events is a tall order; $N$-Fit benefits from transfer learning to efficiently integrate key characteristics, such as the estimation of the closest distance from the event to the detector. $N$-Fit also takes advantage from transfer learning in event topology classification by freezing convolutional layers of the pretrained branches. Tests on Monte Carlo simulations and data demonstrate a significant reduction in mean and median absolute errors across all reconstructed parameters. The improvements achieved by $N$-Fit highlight its potential for advancing multimessenger astrophysics and enhancing our ability to probe fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model using single-line events from ANTARES data.

  abstract: "Beyond the practical goal of improving search and measurement sensitivity through better jet tagging algorithms, there is a deeper question: what are their upper performance limits? Generative surrogate models with learned likelihood functions offer a new approach to this problem, provided the surrogate correctly captures the underlying data distribution. In this work, we introduce the SUrrogate ReFerence (SURF) method, a new approach to validating generative models. This framework enables exact Neyman-Pearson tests by training the target model on samples from another tractable surrogate, which is itself trained on real data. We argue that the EPiC-FM generative model is a valid surrogate reference for JetClass jets and apply SURF to show that modern jet taggers may already be operating close to the true statistical limit. By contrast, we find that autoregressive GPT models unphysically exaggerate top vs. QCD separation power encoded in the surrogate reference, implying that they are giving a misleading picture of the fundamental limit."

  abstract: A search for heavy resonances decaying into a Higgs boson (H) or a Z boson and a photon ($γ$), with the H or Z bosons decaying to a bottom quark-antiquark pair ($\mathrm{b\bar{b}}$) is presented. The analysis is performed using proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The analyzed events contain a photon and a massive large-radius jet originating from a Lorentz-boosted $\mathrm{b\bar{b}}$ system. An advanced transformer-based algorithm classifies jets according to their substructure and quark flavors, forming a tagger that identifies jets as candidates from H/Z $\to$$\mathrm{b\bar{b}}$ decays. A set of parametric functions is used to fit the photon-jet invariant mass spectrum and to extract potential signals. No significant excess is observed above the standard model expectations. The results set upper limits at 95% confidence level on the product of the cross section and the branching fraction for spin-1 H$γ$ resonances and spin-0 Z$γ$ resonances, below 0.1 and 0.3 fb, respectively, representing the most stringent limits to date.

  abstract: Anomaly detection has the potential to discover new physics in unexplored regions of the data. However, choosing the best anomaly detector for a given data set in a model-agnostic way is an important challenge which has hitherto largely been neglected. In this paper, we introduce the data-driven ARGOS metric, which has a sound theoretical foundation and is empirically shown to robustly select the most sensitive anomaly detection model given the data. Focusing on weakly-supervised, classifier-based anomaly detection methods, we show that the ARGOS metric outperforms other model selection metrics previously used in the literature, in particular the binary cross-entropy loss. We explore several realistic applications, including hyperparameter tuning as well as architecture and feature selection, and in all cases we demonstrate that ARGOS is robust to the noisy conditions of anomaly detection.

  abstract: Low latency event-selection (trigger) algorithms are essential components of Large Hadron Collider (LHC) operation. Modern machine learning (ML) models have shown great offline performance as classifiers and could improve trigger performance, thereby improving downstream physics analyses. However, inference on such large models does not satisfy the $40\text{MHz}$ online latency constraint at the LHC. In this work, we propose \texttt{PHAZE}, a novel framework built on cryptographic techniques like hashing and zero-knowledge machine learning (zkML) to achieve low latency inference, via a certifiable, early-exit mechanism from an arbitrarily large baseline model. We lay the foundations for such a framework to achieve nanosecond-order latency and discuss its inherent advantages, such as built-in anomaly detection, within the scope of LHC triggers, as well as its potential to enable a dynamic low-level trigger in the future.

  abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) propagating through the universe can be microlensed by stellar and intermediate-mass objects. Lensing induces frequency-dependent amplification of GWs, which can be computed using \texttt{GLoW}, an accurate code suitable for evaluating this factor for generic lens models and arbitrary impact parameters depending on the lens configuration. For parameter inference, we employ the DINGO algorithm, a machine learning framework based on neural posterior estimation, a simulation-based inference method that uses normalizing flows to efficiently approximate posterior distributions of the physical parameters. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that it enables efficient parameter estimation of diffracted GW signals using an isolated point mass lens model. This method can be useful for rapidly identifying microlensed events within large GW catalogs and for conducting population studies of compact binaries. Compared to traditional parameter estimation techniques, we find that combining DINGO with importance sampling can provide efficient estimation of the background Bayes-factor distribution, which is required in evaluating the significance of candidate lensed events. However, for foreground (lensed) events, care must be taken, as sampling efficiency can decrease when the lensed data lie outside the distribution learned by the unlensed DINGO network. Our framework can be naturally extended to more complex and realistic lens models, allowing detailed analyses of the microlensed GWs.

  abstract: Connecting the formation and evolution of galaxies to the large-scale structure is crucial for interpreting cosmological observations. While hydrodynamical simulations accurately model the correlated properties of galaxies, they are computationally prohibitive to run over volumes that match modern surveys. We address this by developing a framework to rapidly generate mock galaxy catalogs conditioned on inexpensive dark-matter-only simulations. We present a multi-modal, transformer-based model that takes 3D dark matter density and velocity fields as input, and outputs a corresponding point cloud of galaxies with their physical properties. We demonstrate that our trained model faithfully reproduces a variety of galaxy summary statistics and correctly captures their variation with changes in the underlying cosmological and astrophysical parameters, making it the first accelerated forward model to capture all the relevant galaxy properties, their full spatial distribution, and their conditional dependencies in hydrosimulations.

  abstract: "A tau lepton identification algorithm,DeepTau, based on convolutionalneural network techniques, has been developed in the CMS experimentto discriminate reconstructed hadronic decays of tau leptons(τ$_{h}$) from quark or gluon jets andelectrons and muons that are misreconstructed asτ$_{h}$ candidates. The latest version ofthis algorithm, v2.5, includes domain adaptation by backpropagation,a technique that reduces discrepancies between collision data andsimulation in the region with the highest purity of genuineτ$_{h}$ candidates. Additionally, arefined training workflow improves classification performance withrespect to the previous version of the algorithm, with a reductionof 30–50% in the probability for quark and gluon jets to bemisidentified as τ$_{h}$ candidates forgiven reconstruction and identification efficiencies. This paperpresents the novel improvements introduced in theDeepTau algorithm and evaluatesits performance in LHC proton-proton collision data at √(s) = 13and 13.6 TeV collected in 2018 and 2022 withintegrated luminosities of 60 and35 fb$^{-1}$, respectively. Techniques tocalibrate the performance of the τ$_{h}$\_identification algorithm in simulation with respect to its measuredperformance in real data are presented, together with a subset ofresults among those measured for use in CMS physics analyses."

  abstract: We introduce theoretically grounded Continuous Semi-Quantum Boltzmann Machines (CSQBMs) that supports continuous-action reinforcement learning. By combining exponential-family priors over visible units with quantum Boltzmann distributions over hidden units, CSQBMs yield a hybrid quantum-classical model that reduces qubit requirements while retaining strong expressiveness. Crucially, gradients with respect to continuous variables can be computed analytically, enabling direct integration into Actor-Critic algorithms. Building on this, we propose a continuous Q-learning framework that replaces global maximization by efficient sampling from the CSQBM distribution, thereby overcoming instability issues in continuous control.

  abstract: We introduce Accelerated Sequential Posterior Inference via Reuse (ASPIRE), a broadly applicable framework that transforms existing posterior samples and Bayesian evidence estimates into unbiased results under alternative models without rerunning the original analysis. ASPIRE combines normalizing flows with a generalized Sequential Monte Carlo scheme, enabling efficient updates of existing results and reducing the computational cost of reanalyses by 4-10 times. This addresses a growing problem in gravitational-wave astronomy, where events must be repeatedly reanalyzed under different models or physical hypotheses. We show that ASPIRE reproduces full Bayesian results when switching waveform models or adding physical effects such as spin precession and orbital eccentricity. With this statistical robustness, ASPIRE turns repeated reanalyses into fast, reliable updatespaving the way for systematic studies of waveform systematics, scalable reanalyses across large event catalogs, and broadly applicable Bayesian reanalysis across other scientific domains.

  abstract: We present CaloClouds3, a model for the fast simulation of photon showers in the barrel of a high granularity detector. This iteration demonstrates for the first time how a pointcloud model can employ angular conditioning to replicate photons at all incident angles. Showers produced by this model can be used across the whole detector barrel, due to specially produced position agnostic training data. With this flexibility, the model is usable in a full simulation and reconstruction chain, which offers a further handle for evaluating physics performance of the model. As inference time is a crucial consideration for a generative model, the pre-processing and hyperparameters are aggressively optimised, achieving a speed up factor of two orders of magnitude over Geant4 at inference.

  abstract: We present a first joint extraction of the Collins-Soper kernel (CSK) combining experimental and lattice QCD data in the context of an analysis of transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (TMDs). Based on a neural-network parametrization, we perform a Bayesian reweighting of an existing fits of TMDs using lattice data, as well as a joint TMD fit to lattice and experimental data. We consistently find that the inclusion of lattice information shifts the central value of the CSK by approximately 10% and reduces its uncertainty by 40-50%, highlighting the potential of lattice inputs to improve TMD extractions.

  abstract: Unfolding, for example of distortions imparted by detectors, provides suitable and publishable representations of LHC data. Many methods for unbinned and high-dimensional unfolding using machine learning have been proposed, but no generative method scales to the several hundred dimensions necessary to fully characterize LHC collisions. This paper proposes a 3-stage generative unfolding framework that is capable of unfolding several hundred dimensions. It is effective to unfold the jet-level kinematics as well as the full substructure of light-flavor jets and of top jets, and is the first generative unfolding study to achieve high precision on high-dimensional jet substructure.

  abstract: "Machine learning has the potential to improve the reconstruction of the dark matter profile of galaxies with respect to traditional methods, like rotation curves. We demonstrate on the simulation suite Illustris-TNG that a steerable equivariant convolutional neural network (CNN) is able to infer the dark matter profiles within and around individual galaxies from photometric and interferometric data, improving on a standard CNN. Within the in silico environment of the simulations, our architecture is able to capture the dark matter distribution within galaxies without a parametrization of the profile. We perform an interpretability analysis to understand the internal mechanisms of the trained model and the most important data features used to estimate the dark matter profiles. The equivariant CNN recovers the dark matter profile of galaxies within the stellar mass range $[10^{10} - 10^{12} ]$$M_{\\odot}$ with excellent precision and accuracy: the mean squared error is reduced by a factor of ~ 3 from its value under the training distribution, demonstrating that the network has learnt from the data features. While this holds within the controlled 'in silico' environment of the simulation, we argue that few additional steps are needed before this method can be reliably applied to galaxies in the real field observations."

By leveraging the representational power of deep neural networks, SBI can extract the most informative simulation features for the parameters of interest. Sequential SBI methods extend this approach by iteratively steering the simulation process towards the most relevant regions of parameter space. This is typically implemented through an algorithmic structure, in which simulation and network training alternate over multiple rounds. This strategy is particularly well suited for high-precision inference in high-dimensional settings, which are commonplace in physics applications with growing data volumes and increasing model fidelity. Here, we introduce dynamic SBI, which implements the core ideas of sequential methods in a round-free, asynchronous, and highly parallelisable manner. At its core is an adaptive dataset that is iteratively transformed during inference to resemble the target observation. Simulation and training proceed in parallel: trained networks are used both to filter out simulations incompatible with the data and to propose new, more promising ones. Compared to round-based sequential methods, this asynchronous structure can significantly reduce simulation costs and training overhead. We demonstrate that dynamic SBI achieves significant improvements in simulation and training efficiency while maintaining inference performance. We further validate our framework on two challenging astrophysical inference tasks: characterising the stochastic gravitational wave background and analysing strong gravitational lensing systems. Overall, this work presents a flexible and efficient new paradigm for sequential SBI."

  abstract: The advent of Stage IV galaxy redshift surveys such as DESI and Euclid marks the beginning of an era of precision cosmology, with one key objective being the detection of primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG), potential signatures of inflationary physics. In particular, constraining the amplitude of local-type PNG, parameterised by $f_{\rm NL}$, with $σ_{f_{\rm NL}} \sim 1$, would provide a critical test of single versus multi-field inflation scenarios. While current large-scale structure and cosmic microwave background analyses have achieved $σ_{f_{\rm NL}} \sim 5$-$9$, further improvements demand novel data compression strategies. We propose a hybrid estimator that hierarchically combines standard $2$-point and $3$-point statistics with a field-level neural summary, motivated by recent theoretical work that shows that such a combination is nearly optimal, disentangling primordial from late-time non-Gaussianity. We employ PatchNet, a convolutional neural network that extracts small-scale information from sub-volumes (patches) of the halo number density field while large-scale information is retained via the power spectrum and bispectrum. Using Quijote-PNG simulations, we evaluate the Fisher information of this combined estimator across various redshifts, halo mass cuts, and scale cuts. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of patch-based field-level compression always enhances constraints on $f_{\rm NL}$, reaching gains of $30$-$45\%$ at low $k_{\rm max}$ ($\sim 0.1 \, h \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$), and capturing information beyond the bispectrum. This approach offers a computationally efficient and scalable pathway to tighten the PNG constraints from forthcoming survey data.

  abstract: "We present Qiboml, an open-source software library for orchestrating quantum and classical components in hybrid machine learning workflows. Building on Qibo's quantum computing capabilities and integrating with popular machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, Qiboml enables the construction of quantum and hybrid models that can run on a broad range of backends: (i) multi-threaded CPUs, GPUs, and multi-GPU systems for simulation with statevector or tensor network methods; (ii) quantum processing units, both on-premise and through cloud providers. In this paper, we showcase its functionalities, including diverse simulation options, noise-aware simulations, and real-time error mitigation and calibration."

  abstract: Measurements in the highly Lorentz-boosted regime provokeincreased interest in probing the Higgs boson properties and insearching for particles beyond the standard model at the LHC. Inthe CMS Collaboration, various boosted-object tagging algorithms,designed to identify hadronic jets originating from a massiveparticle decaying to bb̅ orcc̅, have been developedand deployed across a range of physics analyses. This paperhighlights their performance on simulated events, and summarizesnovel calibration techniques using proton-proton collision datacollected at √(s) = 13 TeV during the 2016–2018 LHCdata-taking period. Three dedicated methods are used for thecalibration in multijet events, leveraging either machine learningtechniques, the presence of muons within energetic boosted jets, orthe reconstruction of hadronically decaying high-energyZ bosons. The calibration results, obtainedthrough a combination of these approaches, are presented anddiscussed.

  abstract: Event reconstruction at the LHC, the task of assigning observed physics objects to their true origins, is a central challenge for precision measurements and searches. Many existing machine learning approaches address this problem but rely on a single event topology, restricting their applicability to realistic analyses where multiple signal and background processes with different structures are present. To overcome this, we present TIGER, a novel hierarchical graph network that is fundamentally topology agnostic. By incorporating only the common underlying structure of sequential two-body decays, our model can reconstruct complex events without process-specific assumptions. This flexible architecture supports multitask learning, enabling simultaneous event reconstruction and classification. TIGER thus provides a powerful and generalizable tool for physics analysis at the LHC.

  abstract: Theories with a sign problem due to a complex action or Boltzmann weight can sometimes be numerically solved using a stochastic process in the complexified configuration space. However, the probability distribution effectively sampled by this complex Langevin process is not known a priori and notoriously hard to understand. In generative AI, diffusion models can learn distributions, or their log derivatives, from data. We explore the ability of diffusion models to learn the distributions sampled by a complex Langevin process, comparing score-based and energy-based diffusion models, and speculate about possible applications.

  abstract: We propose a novel use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as unsupervised anomaly detectors in particle physics. Using lightweight LLM-like networks with encoder-based architectures trained to reconstruct background events via masked-token prediction, our method identifies anomalies through deviations in reconstruction performance, without prior knowledge of signal characteristics. Applied to searches for simultaneous four-top-quark production, this token-based approach shows competitive performance against established unsupervised methods and effectively captures subtle discrepancies in collider data, suggesting a promising direction for model-independent searches for new physics.

  abstract: High-Energy Physics experiments are rapidly escalating in generated data volume, a trend that will intensify with the upcoming High-Luminosity LHC upgrade. This surge in data necessitates critical revisions across the data processing pipeline, with particle track reconstruction being a prime candidate for improvement. In our previous work, we introduced "TrackFormers", a collection of Transformer-based one-shot encoder-only models that effectively associate hits with expected tracks. In this study, we extend our earlier efforts by incorporating loss functions that account for inter-hit correlations, conducting detailed investigations into (various) Transformer attention mechanisms, and a study on the reconstruction of higher-level objects. Furthermore we discuss new datasets that allow the training on hit level for a range of physics processes. These developments collectively aim to boost both the accuracy, and potentially the efficiency of our tracking models, offering a robust solution to meet the demands of next-generation high-energy physics experiments.

  abstract: The High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will reach luminosities up to 7 times higher than the previous run, yielding denser events and larger occupancies. Next generation trigger algorithms must retain reliable selection within a strict latency budget. This work explores machine-learning approaches for future muon triggers, using the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer as a benchmark. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used as a reference, while a Graph Neural Network (GNN) is introduced as a natural model for sparse detector data. Preliminary single-track studies show that GNNs achieve high efficiency with compact architectures, an encouraging result in view of FPGA deployment.

  abstract: Calorimeter shower simulations are computationally expensive, and generative models offer an efficient alternative. However, achieving a balance between accuracy and speed remains a challenge, with distribution tail modeling being a key limitation. Invertible generative network CaloINN provides a trade-off between simulation quality and efficiency. The ongoing study targets introducing a set of post-processing modifications of analysis-level observables aimed at improving the accuracy of distribution tails. As part of interTwin project initiative developing an open-source Digital Twin Engine, we implemented the CaloINN within the interTwin AI framework.

  abstract: The increasing volume of gamma-ray data demands new analysis approaches that can handle large-scale datasets while providing robustness for source detection. We present a Deep Learning (DL) based pipeline for detection, localization, and characterization of gamma-ray sources. We extend our AutoSourceID (ASID) method, initially tested with \textit{Fermi}-LAT simulated data and optical data (MeerLICHT), to Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) simulated data. This end-to-end pipeline demonstrates a versatile framework for future application to other surveys and potentially serves as a building block for a foundational model for astrophysical source detection.

  abstract: This competition in high-energy physics (HEP) and machine learning was the first to strongly emphasise uncertainties in $(H \rightarrow τ^+ τ^-)$ cross-section measurement. Participants were tasked with developing advanced analysis techniques capable of dealing with uncertainties in the input training data and providing credible confidence intervals. The accuracy of these intervals was evaluated using pseudo-experiments to assess correct coverage. The dataset is now published in Zenodo, and the winning submissions are fully documented.

  abstract: Future high-luminosity hadron colliders demand tracking detectors with extreme radiation tolerance, high spatial precision, and sub-nanosecond timing. 3D diamond pixel sensors offer these capabilities due to diamond's radiation hardness and high carrier mobility. Conductive electrodes, produced via femtosecond IR laser pulses, exhibit high resistivity that delays signal propagation. This effect necessitates extending the classical Ramo-Shockley weighting potential formalism. We model the phenomenon through a 3rd-order, 3+1D PDE derived as a quasi-stationary approximation of Maxwell's equations. The PDE is solved numerically and coupled with charge transport simulations for realistic 3D sensor geometries. A Mixture-of-Experts Physics-Informed Neural Network, trained on Spectral Method data, provides a meshless solver to assess timing degradation from electrode resistance.

  abstract: "We study star formation over 12 Gyr using pop-cosmos, a generative model trained on 26-band photometry of 420,000 COSMOS2020 galaxies (IRAC Ch.1 $<26$). The model learns distributions over 16 SPS parameters via score-based diffusion, matching observed colours and magnitudes. We compute the star formation rate density (SFRD) to $z=3.5$ by directly integrating individual galaxy SFRs. The SFRD peaks at $z=1.3\\pm0.1$, with peak value $0.08\\pm0.01$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. We classify star-forming (SF) and quiescent (Q) galaxies using specific SFR $<10^{-11}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparing with $NUVrJ$ colour selection. The sSFR criterion yields up to 20% smaller quiescent fractions across $0<z<3.5$, with $NUVrJ$-selected samples contaminated by galaxies with sSFR up to $10^{-9}$ yr$^{-1}$. Our sSFR-selected stellar mass function shows a negligible number density of low-mass ($<10^{9.5}$ M$_\\odot$) Q galaxies at $z\\sim1$, where colour-selection shows a prominent increase. Non-parametric star formation histories around the SFRD peak reveal distinct patterns: SF galaxies show gradually decreasing SFR correlations with lookback time ($r\\sim1$ to $r\\sim0$ over 13 Gyr), implying increasingly stochastic star formation toward early epochs. Q galaxies exhibit full correlation ($r>0.95$) during the most recent $\\sim$300 Myr, then sharp decorrelation with earlier star-forming epochs, marking clear quenching transitions. Massive ($10<\\log_{10}(M_*/$M$_{\\odot})<11$) galaxies quench on a time-scale of $\\sim1$ Gyr, with mass assembly concentrated in their first 3.5 Gyr. Finally, AGN activity (infrared luminosity) peaks as massive ($\\sim10^{10.5}$ M$_\\odot$) galaxies approach the transition between star-forming and quiescent states, declining sharply once quiescence is established. This provides evidence that AGN feedback operates in a critical regime during the $\\sim1$ Gyr quenching transition."

  abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs), hypothetical pseudoscalar particles that couple to photons, are among the most actively investigated candidates for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Their interaction with gamma rays in the presence of astrophysical magnetic fields can leave characteristic, energy-dependent modulations in observed spectra. Capturing such subtle features requires precise statistical inference, but standard likelihood-based methods often fall short when faced with complex models, large number of nuisance parameters and limited analytical tractability. In this work, we investigate the application of simulation-based inference (SBI), specifically Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE), to constrain ALP parameters using simulated observations from the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). We model the gamma-ray emission from the active galactic nucleus NGC 1275, accounting for photon-ALP mixing, extragalactic background light (EBL) absorption, and the full CTAO instrument response. Leveraging the Swyft framework, we infer posteriors for the ALP mass and coupling strength and demonstrate its potential to extract meaningful constraints on ALPs from future real gamma-ray data with CTAO.

  abstract: The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is an international observatory currentlyunder construction, which will consist of two sites (one in the Northern Hemisphere and one in theSouthern Hemisphere). It will eventually be the largest and most sensitive ground-based gamma-ray observatory. In the meantime, a small subarray composed of four Large-Sized Telescopes(LSTs) at the Northern site will begin collecting data in the coming year. In preparation, wepresent a stereoscopic event reconstruction using graph neural networks (GNNs) to combineinformation from several telescopes of this subarray. In our previous work, we explored the use ofGNNs for the stereoscopic reconstruction of gamma-ray events on simulated data from the Prod5sample and showed that GNNs provide a better stereoscopic reconstruction. We now compare thisapproach to the currently foreseen method that analytically combines the output of monoscopicrandom forests, and explore how GNNs can be used in fusion with the Random forest algorithmin order to provide a more sensitive stereoscopic system.

  abstract: Experimental studies of beauty hadron decays face significant challenges due to a wide range of backgrounds arising from the numerous possible decay channels with similar final states. For a particular signal decay, the process for ascertaining the most relevant background processes necessitates a detailed analysis of final state particles, potential misidentifications, and kinematic overlaps, which, due to computational limitations, is restricted to the simulation of only the most relevant backgrounds. Moreover, this process typically relies on the physicist's intuition and expertise, as no systematic method exists. This paper has two primary goals. First, from a particle physics perspective, we present a novel approach that utilises Reinforcement Learning (RL) to overcome the aforementioned challenges by systematically determining the critical backgrounds affecting beauty hadron decay measurements. While beauty hadron physics serves as the case study in this work, the proposed strategy is broadly adaptable to other types of particle physics measurements. Second, from a Machine Learning perspective, we introduce a novel algorithm which exploits the synergy between RL and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for environments with highly sparse rewards and a large trajectory space. This strategy leverages GAs to efficiently explore the trajectory space and identify successful trajectories, which are used to guide the RL agent's training. Our method also incorporates a transformer architecture for the RL agent to handle token sequences representing decays.

  abstract: "This paper presents a search for new physics through the process where a massive particle, X, decays into a Higgs boson and a second particle, Y. The Higgs boson subsequently decays into a bottom quark–antiquark pair, which is reconstructed as a single large-radius jet. The decay products of Yare also assumed to produce a single large-radius jet. The identification of the Yparticle is enhanced by computing the anomaly score of its candidate jet using an autoencoder, which measures deviations from typical quark- or gluon-induced jets. This allows a simultaneous search for multiple Ydecay scenarios within a single analysis. In the main benchmark process, Yis a scalar particle that decays into a Wboson pair. Two other scalar Ydecay processes are also considered as benchmarks: decays to a light quark–antiquark pair, and decays to a top quark–antiquark pair. A fourth benchmark process considers Yas a hadronically decaying top quark, arising from the decay of a vector-like quark into a top quark and a Higgs boson. Data recorded by the CMS experiment at a center-of-mass energy of 13$\\,\\text {Te}\\hspace{-.08em}\\text {V}$ in 2016–2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138$\\,\\text {fb}^{-1}$, are analyzed. The search covers Xmasses between 1.4 and 3.0$\\,\\text {Te}\\hspace{-.08em}\\text {V}$ and Ymasses between 90 and 400$\\,\\text {Ge}\\hspace{-.08em}\\text {V}$, with all simulated signals produced in the narrow-width approximation. No significant excess above the standard model background expectation is observed. The most stringent upper limits to date are placed on benchmark signal cross sections for various masses of X and Y particles"

  abstract: We demonstrate a GPU-accelerated nested sampling framework for efficient high-dimensional Bayesian inference in cosmology. Using JAX-based neural emulators and likelihoods for cosmic microwave background and cosmic shear analyses, our approach provides parameter constraints and direct calculation of Bayesian evidence. In the 39-dimensional $Λ$CDM vs $w_0w_a$ shear analysis, we produce Bayes factors and a robust error bar in just 2 days on a single A100 GPU, without loss of accuracy. Where CPU-based nested sampling can now be outpaced by methods relying on MCMC sampling and decoupled evidence estimation, we demonstrate that with GPU acceleration nested sampling offers the necessary speed-up to put it on equal computational footing with these methods, especially where reliable model comparison is paramount. We also explore interpolation in the matter power spectrum for cosmic shear analysis, finding a further factor of 4 speed-up with consistent posterior contours and Bayes factor. We put forward both nested and gradient-based sampling as useful tools for the modern cosmologist, where cutting-edge inference pipelines can yield orders of magnitude improvements in computation time.

  abstract: "Precision cosmology with Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) requires robust quality control of large, heterogeneous datasets. Current data processing often relies on manual, subjective rejection of photometric data, a practice that is not scalable for forthcoming surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We present a Bayesian framework that automates this step by integrating anomaly detection directly into the light curve fitting process. While the framework is model-agnostic and compatible with any spectral energy distribution (SED) model, here we demonstrate its application with the SALT3 model, implemented fully on GPU using \\texttt{JAX-bandflux} for computational efficiency. Our method models the probability of each photometric measurement being anomalous with respect to the model, simultaneously inferring the physical supernova parameters and each data point's posterior probability of being a contaminant. Applying this framework to the Hawaii Supernova Flows dataset, we demonstrate its three principal capabilities: (i) robust mitigation of isolated outliers; (ii) automated identification and rejection of entirely corrupted bandpasses; and (iii) preservation of valid data by flagging only specific anomalous points within otherwise usable filters. We also find that contaminants are systematically brighter and bluer, which if uncorrected could bias subsequent cosmological inference."

  abstract: At hadron colliders, the net transverse momentum of particles that do not interact with the detector (missing transverse momentum, $\vec{p}_\mathrm{T}^\text{miss}$) is a crucial observable in many analyses. In the standard model, $\vec{p}_\mathrm{T}^\text{miss}$ originates from neutrinos. Many beyond-the-standard-model particles, such as dark matter candidates, are also expected to leave the experimental apparatus undetected. This paper presents a novel $\vec{p}_\mathrm{T}^\text{miss}$ estimator, DeepMET, which is based on deep neural networks that were developed by the CMS Collaboration at the LHC. The DeepMET algorithm produces a weight for each reconstructed particle based on its properties. The estimator is based on the negative vector sum of the weighted transverse momenta of all reconstructed particles in an event. Compared with other estimators currently employed by CMS, DeepMET improves the $\vec{p}_\mathrm{T}^\text{miss}$ resolution by 10$-$30%, shows improvement for a wide range of final states, is easier to train, and is more resilient against the effects of additional proton-proton interactions accompanying the collision of interest.

  abstract: "We present a new extraction of unpolarized Dihadron Fragmentation Functions, which describe the probability density for an unpolarized parton to fragment into a π$^{+}$π$^{−}$ pair. Our analysis is based on data from the BELLE collaboration. We improve on previous determinations in several key aspects: we employ state-of-the-art perturbative QCD calculations up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO); we limit the use of Monte Carlo event generators to estimating the relative contributions of different flavors, a necessary input due to the limited flavor sensitivity of the available data; and, in addition to a traditional fit based on a physics-informed functional form, we explore a Neural Network parametrization. This latter approach paves the way for more robust and flexible determinations of Dihadron Fragmentation Functions using machine learning techniques."

  abstract: The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is one of the intriguing mysteries in astroparticle physics.In order to identify their sources, we need precise knowledge of the mass composition of UHECRs.The direct detection of UHECRs is not feasible at energies above 0.1 PeV, necessitating the use of mass-sensitive observables of extended air showers induced by UHECRs interacting with the atmosphere.One way to achieve high statistics for these mass-sensitive observables is to use ground-based detector arrays, such as the Surface Detector (SD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory.The SD consists of three sub-arrays of independent detector stations arranged in triangular grids with different spacings.Recently, it has been shown that neural networks (NNs) can extract mass-sensitive observables from data taken by the SD-1500, the largest sub-detector of the SD.In this contribution, we demonstrate the feasibility of using NNs to reconstruct a high-level shower observable, the depth of the shower maximum, from data simulated for and observed by the SD-750, the second-largest detector array nested within the SD-1500.A simulation study shows that the SD-750 NN exhibits behavior similar to that of an SD-1500 NN and outperforms the latter in the energy range [1, 10) EeV.Moreover, we show that, after performing a correction and calibration procedure, the predictions of the SD-750 NN are consistent with the measurement of the depth of the shower maximum obtained by the Fluorescence Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory.

  abstract: "The substantial data volumes encountered in modern particle physics and other domains of fundamental physics research allow (and require) the use of increasingly complex data analysis tools and workflows. While the use of machine learning (ML) tools for data analysis has recently proliferated, these tools are typically special-purpose algorithms that rely, for example, on encoded physics knowledge to reach optimal performance. In this work, we investigate a new and orthogonal direction: Using recent progress in large language models (LLMs) to create a team of agents -- instances of LLMs with specific subtasks -- that jointly solve data analysis-based research problems in a way similar to how a human researcher might: by creating code to operate standard tools and libraries (including ML systems) and by building on results of previous iterations. If successful, such agent-based systems could be deployed to automate routine analysis components to counteract the increasing complexity of modern tool chains. To investigate the capabilities of current-generation commercial LLMs, we consider the task of anomaly detection via the publicly available and highly-studied LHC Olympics dataset. Several current models by OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5) are investigated and their stability tested. Overall, we observe the capacity of the agent-based system to solve this data analysis problem. The best agent-created solutions mirror the performance of human state-of-the-art results."

  abstract: A model-independent measurement of the differential production cross section of the Higgs boson decaying into a pair of W bosons, with a final state including two jets produced in association, is presented. In the analysis, events are selected in which the decay products of the two W bosons consist of an electron, a muon, and missing transverse momentum. The model independence of the measurement is maximized by making use of a discriminating variable that is agnostic to the signal hypothesis developed through machine learning. The analysis is based on proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector from 2012$-$2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The production cross section is measured as a function of the difference in azimuthal angle between the two jets. The differential cross section measurements are used to constrain Higgs boson couplings within the standard model effective field theory framework.

  abstract: The complexity of large-scale 6G-and-beyond networks demands innovative approaches for multi-objective optimization over vast search spaces, a task often intractable. Quantum computing (QC) emerges as a promising technology for efficient large-scale optimization. We present our vision of leveraging QC to tackle key classes of problems in future mobile networks. By analyzing and identifying common features, particularly their graph-centric representation, we propose a unified strategy involving QC algorithms. Specifically, we outline a methodology for optimization using quantum annealing as well as quantum reinforcement learning. Additionally, we discuss the main challenges that QC algorithms and hardware must overcome to effectively optimize future networks.

  abstract: High-multiplicity events remain a bottleneck for LHC simulations due to their computational cost. We present a ML-surrogate approach to accelerate matrix element reweighting from leading-color (LC) to full-color (FC) accuracy, building on recent advancements in LC event generation. Comparing a variety of modern network architectures for representative QCD processes, we achieve speed-up of around a factor two over the current LC-to-FC baseline. We also show how transformers learn and exploit underlying symmetries, to improve generalization. Given the gained trust in trained networks and developments in learned uncertainties, the LC-to-FC approach will eventually benefit further from not needing a final classic unweighting step.

  abstract: Simulation-based inference has been shown to outperform traditional, histogram-based inference in numerous phenomenological and experimental studies. So far, these analyses have focused on individual high-profile processes. We study the combination of four different di-boson processes in terms of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory. Our results demonstrate how simulation-based inference also wins over traditional methods for global LHC analyses.

  abstract: The discovery of gravitational waves (GWs) from merging compact binaries has transformed modern astrophysics, driving innovation in detection methodologies. Whereas matched-filtering techniques have long been the standard, the growing volume of data from advanced observatories like LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA has spurred interest in machine learning (ML) solutions for their scalability and computational efficiency. As next-generation detectors approach reality, the development of reliable and adaptable search algorithms becomes increasingly urgent. This work examines the consistency of detection sensitivity in AresGW model 1, an ML-based pipeline, when applied to multiple month-long datasets consisting of real detector noise. By analyzing the number of waveform injections detected and the sensitive distance at different FAR thresholds, we evaluate the model's performance under low false alarm rates and investigate how sensitivity metrics fluctuate due to dataset variability. In addition, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm on data both with and without contamination of genuine GW signals. Our findings reveal notable performance variations, highlighting the challenges introduced by finite-duration datasets and emphasizing the need for more rigorous statistical validation. By identifying these challenges, we aim to clarify the practical limitations of both ML-based and traditional detection systems and inform future benchmarking standards for GW searches.

  abstract: We present iHOMER, an iterative version of the HOMER method to extract Lund fragmentation functions from experimental data. Through iterations, we address the information gap between latent and observable phase spaces and systematically remove bias. To quantify uncertainties on the inferred weights, we use a combination of Bayesian neural networks and uncertainty-aware regression. We find that the combination of iterations and uncertainty quantification produces well-calibrated weights that accurately reproduce the data distribution. A parametric closure test shows that the iteratively learned fragmentation function is compatible with the true fragmentation function.

  abstract: \textit{What is the cosmological information content of a cubic Gigaparsec of dark matter? } Extracting cosmological information from the non-linear matter distribution has high potential to tighten parameter constraints in the era of next-generation surveys such as Euclid, DESI, and the Vera Rubin Observatory. Traditional approaches relying on summary statistics like the power spectrum and bispectrum, though analytically tractable, fail to capture the full non-Gaussian and non-linear structure of the density field. Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) provides a powerful alternative by learning directly from forward-modeled simulations. In this work, we apply SBI to the \textit{Quijote} dark matter simulations and introduce a hierarchical method that integrates small-scale information from field sub-volumes or \textit{patches} with large-scale statistics such as power spectrum and bispectrum. This hybrid strategy is efficient both computationally and in terms of the amount of training data required. It overcomes the memory limitations associated with full-field training. We show that our approach enhances Fisher information relative to analytical summaries and matches that of a very different approach (wavelet-based statistics), providing evidence that we are estimating the full information content of the dark matter density field at the resolution of $\sim 7.8~\mathrm{Mpc}/h$.

  abstract: Machine Learning (ML)-based unfolding methods have enabled high-dimensional and unbinned differential cross section measurements. While a suite of such methods has been proposed, most focus exclusively on the challenge of statistically removing resolution effects. In practice, unfolding methods must also account for impurities and finite acceptance and efficiency effects. In this paper, we extend a class of unfolding methods based on generative ML to include the full suite of effects relevant for cross section measurements. Our new methods include fully generative solutions as well as generative-discriminative hybrid approaches (GenFoldG and GenFoldC). We demonstrate these new techniques in both Gaussian and simulated LHC examples. Overall, we find that both methods are able to accommodate all effects, thus adding a complementary and analysis-ready method to the unfolding toolkit.

  abstract: "Precision measurements of neutron properties, like its permanent electric dipole moment, rely on understanding complex experimental setups in detail. We show how the properties of stored and transported ultracold neutron ensembles can be simulated reliably. In a second step, we illustrate how they can be used for simulation-based inference of the parameters associated with underlying physics processes such as neutron capture or beta decay. Our proof of principle for simulation-based inference confronts a longstanding challenge with ultracold neutrons: low measurement statistics coupled with a complex apparatus."

  abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is one of the essential steps to guarantee the convergence of machine learning models. We argue that intuition about the optimal choice of hyperparameters for stochastic gradient descent can be obtained by studying a neural network’s phase diagram, in which each phase is characterised by distinctive dynamics of the singular values of weight matrices. Taking inspiration from disordered systems, we start from the observation that the loss landscape of a multilayer neural network with mean squared error can be interpreted as a disordered system in feature space, where the learnt features are mapped to soft spin degrees of freedom, the initial variance of the weight matrices is interpreted as the strength of the disorder, and temperature is given by the ratio of the learning rate and the batch size. As the model is trained, three phases can be identified, in which the dynamics of weight matrices is qualitatively different. Employing a Langevin equation for stochastic gradient descent, previously derived using Dyson Brownian motion, we demonstrate that the three dynamical regimes can be classified effectively, providing practical guidance for the choice of hyperparameters of the optimiser.

  abstract: "Recently, the benefit of heavily overparameterized models has been observed in machine learning tasks: models with enough capacity to easily cross the \\emph{interpolation threshold} improve in generalization error compared to the classical bias-variance tradeoff regime. We demonstrate this behavior for the first time in particle physics data and explore when and where `double descent' appears and under which circumstances overparameterization results in a performance gain."

  abstract: A model-agnostic search for Beyond the Standard Model physics is presented, targeting final states with at least four light leptons (electrons or muons). The search regions are separated by event topology and unsupervised machine learning is used to identify anomalous events in the full 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data collected with the ATLAS detector during Run 2. No significant excess above the Standard Model background expectation is observed. Model-agnostic limits are presented in each topology, along with limits on several benchmark models including vector-like leptons, wino-like charginos and neutralinos, or smuons. Limits are set on the flavourful vector-like lepton model for the first time.

  abstract: We present a comparative study of Higgs event classification at the Large Hadron Collider that bypasses the traditional reconstruction chain. As a benchmark, we focus on distinguishing $t\bar{t}H$ from $t\bar{t}$ events with $H \to b\bar{b}$, a particularly challenging task due to their similar final-state topologies. Our pipeline begins with event generation in Pythia8, fast simulation with ACTS/Fatras, and classification directly from raw detector hits. We show for the first time that a transformer model originally developed for inner tracker hit-to-track assignment can be retrained to classify Higgs events directly from raw hits. For comparison, we reconstruct the same events with \texttt{Delphes} and train object-based classifiers, including multilayer perceptrons and the Particle Transformer. We evaluate both approaches under varying dataset sizes and pileup levels. Although Higgsformer works exclusively with inner tracker hits (i.e., without calorimeter or muon information), it achieves strong performance with an AUC value of 0.792.

  abstract: Gravitational waves from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), the inspirals of stellar-mass compact objects into massive black holes, are predicted to be observed by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). A sufficiently large number of EMRI observations will provide unique insights into the massive black hole population. We have developed a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework capable of constraining the parameters of the EMRI population, accounting for selection biases. We leverage the capacity of a feed-forward neural network as an emulator, enabling detectability calculations of $\sim10^5$ EMRIs in a fraction of a second, speeding up the likelihood evaluation by $\gtrsim6$ orders of magnitude. We validate our framework on a phenomenological EMRI population model. This framework enables studies of how well we can constrain EMRI population parameters, such as the slope of both the massive and stellar-mass black hole mass spectra and the branching fractions of different formation channels, allowing further investigation into the evolution of massive black holes.

  abstract: Using type Ia supernovae (SNae Ia) as cosmological probes requires empirical corrections, which correlate with their host environment. We present a unified Bayesian hierarchical model designed to infer, from purely photometric observations, the intrinsic dependence of SN Ia brightness on progenitor properties (metallicity & age), the delay-time distribution (DTD) that governs their rate as a function of age, and cosmology, as well as the redshifts of all hosts. The model incorporates physics-based prescriptions for star formation and chemical evolution from Prospector-beta, dust extinction of both galaxy and SN light, and observational selection effects. We show with simulations that intrinsic dependences on metallicity and age have distinct observational signatures, with metallicity mimicking the well-known step of SN Ia magnitudes across a host stellar mass of $\approx 10^{10} M_{\odot}$. We then demonstrate neural simulation-based inference of all model parameters from mock observations of ~16 000 SNae Ia and their hosts up to redshift 0.9. Our joint physics-based approach delivers robust and precise photometric redshifts (<0.01 median scatter) and improved cosmological constraints, unlocking the full power of photometric data and paving the way for an end-to-end simulation-based analysis pipeline in the LSST era.

  abstract: Lorentz Local Canonicalization (LLoCa) ensures exact Lorentz-equivariance for arbitrary neural networks with minimal computational overhead. For the LHC, it equivariantly predicts local reference frames for each particle and propagates any-order tensorial information between them. We apply it to graph networks and transformers. We showcase its cutting-edge performance on amplitude regression, end-to-end event generation, and jet tagging. For jet tagging, we introduce a large top tagging dataset to benchmark LLoCa versions of a range of established benchmark architectures and highlight the importance of symmetry breaking.

  abstract: We present the first implementation of a Continuous Normalizing Flow (CNF) model for unsupervised anomaly detection within the realistic, high-rate environment of the Large Hadron Collider's L1 trigger systems. While CNFs typically define an anomaly score via a probabilistic likelihood, calculating this score requires solving an Ordinary Differential Equation, a procedure too complex for FPGA deployment. To overcome this, we propose a novel, hardware-friendly anomaly score defined as the squared norm of the model's vector field output. This score is based on the intuition that anomalous events require a larger transformation by the flow. Our model, trained via Flow Matching on Standard Model data, is synthesized for an FPGA using the hls4ml and da4ml libraries. We demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies a variety of beyond-the-Standard-Model signatures with performance comparable to existing machine learning-based triggers. The algorithm achieves a latency of a few hundred nanoseconds, or even less when using advanced quantization techniques, and requires minimal FPGA resources, establishing CNFs as a viable new tool for real-time, data-driven discovery at 40 MHz.

  abstract: Modern machine learning techniques can unlock the vast cosmological information encoded in forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) observations. We show that tomographic 21 cm data from the reionisation era can yield stringent tests of inflationary models - here illustrated with Starobinsky $R+R^2$ inflation. Using a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework, we compare neural summaries (convolutional network and vision transformer) with a traditional power spectrum summary and perform a fully joint SBI analysis combining 21 cm data with data of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Forecasts based on realistic mock observations indicate that SKA alone will achieve constraints competitive with Planck, and that the combined SKA + CMB dataset will tighten bounds on both inflationary and $Λ\mathrm{CDM}$ parameters considerably while improving precision on key astrophysical quantities.

  abstract: In both high-energy physics and industry applications, a crowd-sourced approach to difficult problems is becoming increasingly common. These innovative approaches are ideal for the development of future facilities where the simulations can be publicly distributed, such as the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). In this paper, we discuss a so-called ``Power Week" where graduate students were able to learn about machine learning while also contributing to an unsolved problem at a future facility. Here, the problem of interest was the clustering of the forward hadronic calorimeter in the foreseen electron-proton/ion collider experiment (ePIC) detector at the EIC. The different possible approaches, developed over the course of a single week, and their performance are detailed and summarised. Feedback on the format of the week and recommendations for future similar programs are provided in the hopes to inspire future learning opportunities for students that also serve as a crowd-sourced approaches to unsolved problems.

  abstract: Relations between stellar properties independent of the nuclear equation of state offer profound insights into neutron star physics and have practical applications in data analysis by breaking the degeneracy between the parameters of interest. Commonly, these relations are derived from utilizing various realistic nuclear cold hadronic, hyperonic, and hybrid equation of state models, each of which should obey the current multimessenger constraints and cover a wide range of stiffnesses. Concurrently, the field of multimessenger astronomy has been significantly enhanced by the advent of gravitational wave astronomy, which increasingly incorporates deep learning techniques and algorithms. At the same time, x-ray spectral data from NICER based on known pulsars are available, and additional observations are expected from upcoming missions. Therefore, in the coming years, a wealth of information on neutron stars is expected to be gathered from multiple observational channels. In this study, we revisit established universal relations, introduce new ones, and reassess them using a feedforward neural network as a regression model. More specifically, we mainly propose “deep” EoS-insensitive hypersurface relations for rapidly rotating compact objects between several of the star’s global parameters, such as the moment of inertia, the reciprocal of the moment of inertia, the rotational frequency, mass and current multipole moments and the equatorial radius, which achieve an accuracy of within 1% in most cases, with only a small fraction of investigated models exceeding this threshold. While analytical expressions can be used to represent some of these relations, the neural network approach demonstrates superior performance, particularly in complex regions of the parameter space. Furthermore, we use the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret the predictions of the suggested feedforward network, as SHAP is grounded in a robust theoretical framework inspired by the field of cooperative game theory. Most importantly, these highly accurate universal relations, empowered with the interpretability description, could be used in efforts to constrain the high-density equation of state in neutron stars, with the potential to enhance our understanding as new observables emerge.

  abstract: The rise of generative models for scientific research calls for the development of new methods to evaluate their fidelity. A natural framework for addressing this problem is two-sample hypothesis testing, namely the task of determining whether two data sets are drawn from the same distribution. In large-scale and high-dimensional regimes, machine learning offers a set of tools to push beyond the limitations of standard statistical techniques. In this work, we put this claim to the test by comparing a recent proposal from the high-energy physics literature, the New Physics Learning Machine, to perform a classification-based two-sample test against a number of alternative approaches, following the framework presented in [1]. We highlight the efficiency tradeoffs of the method and the computational costs that come from adopting learning-based approaches. Finally, we discuss the advantages of the different methods for different use cases.

  abstract: We explore the use of symbolic regression to derive compact analytical expressions for angular observables relevant to electroweak boson production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Focusing on the angular coefficients that govern the decay distributions of W and Z bosons, we investigate whether symbolic models can well approximate these quantities, typically computed via computationally costly numerical procedures, with high fidelity and interpretability. Using the PySR package, we first validate the approach in controlled settings, namely in angular distributions in lepton-lepton collisions in QED and in leading-order Drell-Yan production at the LHC. We then apply symbolic regression to extract closed-form expressions for the angular coefficients A$_{i}$ as functions of transverse momentum, rapidity, and invariant mass, using next-to-leading order simulations of pp → ℓ$^{+}$ℓ$^{−}$ events. Our results demonstrate that symbolic regression can produce accurate and generalisable expressions that match Monte Carlo predictions within uncertainties, while preserving interpretability and providing insight into the kinematic dependence of angular observables.

  abstract: "Simulation-based inference (SBI) allows fast Bayesian inference for simulators encoding implicit likelihoods. However, some explicit likelihoods cannot be easily reformulated as simulators, hindering their integration into combined analyses within SBI frameworks. One key example in cosmology is given by the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) likelihoods. We present a simple method to construct an effective simulator for any explicit likelihood using samples from a previously converged Markov Chain Monte\_Carlo (MCMC) run. This effective simulator can subsequently be combined with any forward simulator. To illustrate this method, we combine the full Planck CMB likelihoods with a <math display=\"inline\"><mn>3</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>2</mn><mi>pt</mi></math> simulator (cosmic shear, galaxy clustering and their cross-correlation) for a stage IV survey like Euclid, and test evolving dark energy parametrized by the <math display=\"inline\"><msub><mi>w</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><msub><mi>w</mi><mi>a</mi></msub></math> equation of state.

For theoretically and experimentally challenging quark-gluon tagging, we first identify the leading latent features that correlate strongly with physics observables, both in a linear and a non-linear approach. Next, we show how Shapley values can assess feature importance, although the standard implementation assumes independent inputs and can lead to distorted attributions in the presence of correlations. Finally, we use symbolic regression to derive compact formulas to approximate the tagger output.

  abstract: Machine learning allows unfolding high-dimensional spaces without binning at the LHC. The new SPINUP method extracts the unfolded distribution based on a neural network encoding the forward mapping, making it independent of the prior from the simulated training data. It is made efficient through neural importance sampling, and ensembling can be used to estimate the effect of information loss in the forward process. We showcase SPINUP for unfolding detector effects on jet substructure observables and for unfolding to parton level of associated Higgs and single-top production.

  abstract: "Simulation-based inference (SBI) offers a principled and flexible framework for conducting Bayesian inference in any situation where forward simulations are feasible. However, validating the accuracy and reliability of the inferred posteriors remains a persistent challenge. In this work, we point out a simple diagnostic approach rooted in ensemble learning methods to assess the internal consistency of SBI outputs that does not require access to the true posterior. By training multiple neural estimators under identical conditions and evaluating their pairwise Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergences, we define a consistency criterion that quantifies agreement across the ensemble. We highlight two core use cases for this framework: (a) for generating a robust estimate of the systematic uncertainty in parameter reconstruction associated with the training procedure, and (b) for detecting possible model misspecification when using trained estimators on real data. We also demonstrate the relationship between significant KL divergences and issues such as insufficient convergence due to, e.g. too low a simulation budget, or intrinsic variance in the training process. Overall, this ensemble-based diagnostic framework provides a lightweight, scalable, and model-agnostic tool for enhancing the trustworthiness of SBI in scientific applications."

  abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory consists of 1660 water-Cherenkov detectors (WCDs) and 27 fluorescence telescopes, covering a surface of 3000 km$^{2}$ in the province of Mendoza, Argentina. After almost two decades, Auger Phase I has ended the data taking and has already delivered many outstanding physics results. The Auger Observatory is currently running in Phase II, with upgraded detectors for enhanced data of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). During Phase I, several engineering detectors were developed and tested. Some of those developments led to new detectors, which are now part of the upgraded Observatory. For Phase II, the WCDs were upgraded with a surface-scintillator detector, a radio detector, a small photomultiplier, and an upgraded electronics board, facilitating mass-sensitive measurements for source identification of UHECRs. Moreover, an underground muon detector allows for a direct measurement of the muon content of air showers. The Offline framework is the main software for the event reconstruction and detector simulation at the Pierre Auger Observatory. It is continuously being developed to accommodate changes in the detector and new algorithms. It allows the running of various applications, which are made up of individual modules, either on raw data or simulations on an event-by-event basis. The modules can be selected, configured, and run without re-compiling the whole software framework, giving the Auger user the possibility to define and further develop targeted analysis. Reconstructed events are stored in a compact ROOT file for physics analysis. Released versions of the Offline software are available for local installation on several platforms and distributed via the CERN-Virtual Machine File System (CVMFS) using a container. Large productions of shower and detector reference libraries are done with CORSIKA 7 and Offline on the European Grid Infrastructure (EGI) using the Virtual Organization Auger. Various air-shower geometries (up to 89 degrees in zenith) were considered, as well as several primary particles (from light to ultra-heavy nuclei, photons, and neutrinos), hadronic interaction models and detector configurations for Phase I and Phase II. In this contribution, we present the actual efforts and updates on software for data production and reference Monte Carlo simulations for Auger data analysis.

  abstract: Ultra-high-energy photons have long been sought as tracers of the most energetic processes in the Universe. Several sources can contribute to a diffuse photon flux, including interactions of cosmic rays with Galactic matter and radiation fields, as well as more exotic scenarios such as the decay of super-heavy dark matter. Regardless of their origin, the expected flux is extremely low, making direct detection impractical and thereby requiring indirect detection by extensive ground-based detector arrays. In this contribution, we present a novel method for photon–hadron discrimination in the energy range of $50$ to $300\,\text{PeV}$ based on deep learning algorithms. Our approach relies on information from both the Surface Detector (SD) and the Underground Muon Detector (UMD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The SD consists of an array of water-Cherenkov detectors. It is used to measure the electromagnetic and muonic components of extensive air showers at ground level. Meanwhile, the UMD is composed of buried scintillator modules. It is sensitive to air-shower muons with energies above ${\sim}1\,\text{GeV}$, enhancing the identification of muon-poor air showers as initiated by photon primaries. Our method represents air-shower events as graphs, and consequently, the network architecture is composed of graph attention layers. We assess the performance of the method on a data subset and discuss the implications of unblinding the full current dataset, as well as the prospects of the increasing data volume expected in the coming years, particularly in terms of sensitivity to various diffuse fluxes from theoretical predictions.

  abstract: "The surface detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory has recently been upgraded with the additionof radio antennas, forming the radio detector (RD). This contribution outlines the standard methodsfor reconstructing extensive air showers using the RD, along with recent developments.The reconstruction pipeline is based on a robust understanding of the detector itself. The entireinstrument, including the antenna pattern and analog chain, has been meticulously characterizedwithin the Offline software framework, based on measurements in the laboratory as well as in thefield. To ensure data integrity, stations identified as unreliable through monitoring are excludedbefore event reconstruction. Absolute calibration is achieved at the 5% level by analyzing thediffuse galactic radio emission. Next, the electric field that induced voltages in the antenna iscalculated by “unfolding” the antenna response pattern. Key observables, such as the energyfluence (the energy deposited in the ground per unit area) and the arrival time of the pulse,are then determined. With these quantities, shower parameters can be reconstructed with verygood accuracy in two 𝜒2-minimization fits: one to determine the shower’s arrival direction via aspherical wavefront fit (predicted within 0.2°), and the other to estimate the distance to the showermaximum and the electromagnetic cascade energy (predicted within 5%) using a lateral densityfunction."

  abstract: "We present an update on the arrival-direction analyses conducted on intermediate angular scalesusing the complete Phase I data of the Pierre Auger Observatory up to the end of 2022 with atotal exposure of $135{,}000\\,\\text{km}^2\\,\\text{sr}\\,\\text{yr}$. We show the arrival-direction distribution of the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays along the supergalactic plane above $20\\,\\text{EeV}$, and an update in the search formagnetically-induced signatures in the arrival directions.Furthermore, we present the potential of introducing estimators for the rigidity ordering of the events to enhance arrival-direction analyseson small to intermediate angular scales. To achieve this, we take advantage of two estimatorsworking on the response of the surface detector: an analytical fit based on air-shower universalityand a deep neural network."

  abstract: The large-scale dipolar structure in the arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with energies above $8\,$EeV observed by the Pierre Auger Collaboration is a well-established anisotropy measurement. This anisotropy is understood to be of extragalactic origin, as the maximum of the dipolar component is located ${\sim}115^\circ$ away from the Galactic Center. Cosmic rays interact with background radiation and magnetized regions on their path from their sources to Earth. These interactions, which depend on the cosmic-ray energy, charge and mass composition, give rise to different horizons and deflections that are expected to lead to different anisotropies in the arrival directions of cosmic rays at Earth. The Auger Collaboration has determined that the mass composition of cosmic rays at ultra-high energies is mixed, becoming increasingly heavier as a function of energy. Thus, different dipole amplitudes are expected to be measured at a given energy when separating the data into composition-distinct subsets of lighter and heavier elements.In this contribution, we investigate the composition signature on the large-scale anisotropy taking advantage of composition estimators obtained from the data gathered with the surface detector. A way of probing for composition signatures in anisotropy patterns is then to divide the data into subsets of ``lighter'' and ``heavier'' elements per energy bin. In a simulation library, we evaluate the possibility of measuring a separation in total dipole amplitude between two such populations of the measured dataset under a source-agnostic model. We present the results using two different composition estimators, one based on air-shower universality and one inferred with deep learning.

  abstract: We introduce a machine learning (ML) framework called $\texttt{TIER}$ for improving the sensitivity of gravitational wave search pipelines. Typically, search pipelines only use a small region of strain data in the vicinity of a candidate signal to construct the detection statistic. However, extended strain data ($\sim 10$ s) in the candidate's vicinity can also carry valuable complementary information. We show that this information can be efficiently captured by ML classifier models trained on sparse summary representation/features of the extended data. Our framework is easy to train and can be used with already existing candidates from any search pipeline, and without requiring expensive injection campaigns. Furthermore, the output of our model can be easily integrated into the detection statistic of a search pipeline. Using $\texttt{TIER}$ on triggers from the $\texttt{IAS-HM}$ pipeline, we find up to $\sim 20\%$ improvement in sensitive volume time in LIGO-Virgo-Kagra O3 data, with improvements concentrated in regions of high masses and unequal mass ratios. Applying our framework increases the significance of several near-threshold gravitational-wave candidates, especially in the pair-instability mass gap and intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) ranges.

  abstract: We propose a method for estimating the Fisher score--the gradient of the log-likelihood with respect to model parameters--using score matching. By introducing a latent parameter model, we show that the Fisher score can be learned by training a neural network to predict latent scores via a mean squared error loss. We validate our approach on a toy linear Gaussian model and a cosmological example using a differentiable simulator. In both cases, the learned scores closely match ground truth for plausible data-parameter pairs. This method extends the ability to perform Fisher forecasts, and gradient-based Bayesian inference to simulation models, even when they are not differentiable; it therefore has broad potential for advancing cosmological analyses.

  abstract: "Machine learning (ML) techniques have recently enabled enormous gains in sensitivity to new phenomena across the sciences. In particle physics, much of this progress has relied on excellent simulations of a wide range of physical processes. However, due to the sophistication of modern machine learning algorithms and their reliance on high-quality training samples, discrepancies between simulation and experimental data can significantly limit their effectiveness. In this work, we present a solution to this ``misspecification'' problem: a model calibration approach based on optimal transport, which we apply to high-dimensional simulations for the first time. We demonstrate the performance of our approach through jet tagging, using a dataset inspired by the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. A 128-dimensional internal jet representation from a powerful general-purpose classifier is studied; after calibrating this internal ``latent'' representation, we find that a wide variety of quantities derived from it for downstream tasks are also properly calibrated: using this calibrated high-dimensional representation, powerful new applications of jet flavor information can be utilized in LHC analyses. This is a key step toward allowing the unbiased use of ``foundation models'' in particle physics. More broadly, this calibration framework has broad applications for correcting high-dimensional simulations across the sciences."

  abstract: Searching for $\mathcal{CP}$ violation in Higgs interactions at the LHC is as challenging as it is important. Although modern machine learning outperforms traditional methods, its results are difficult to control and interpret, which is especially important if an unambiguous probe of a fundamental symmetry is required. We propose solving this problem by learning analytic formulas with symbolic regression. Using the complementary PySR and SymbolNet approaches, we learn $\mathcal{CP}$-sensitive observables at the detector level for WBF Higgs production and top-associated Higgs production. We find that they offer advantages in interpretability and performance.

  abstract: Driven by the increasing volume of recorded data, the demand for simulation from experiments based at the Large Hadron Collider will rise sharply in the coming years. Addressing this demand solely with existing computationally intensive workflows is not feasible. This paper introduces a new fast simulation tool designed to address this demand at the LHCb experiment. This tool emulates the detector response to arbitrary multibody decay topologies at the LHCb. Rather than memorizing specific decay channels, the model learns generalizable patterns within the response, allowing it to interpolate to channels not present in the training data. Novel heterogeneous graph neural network architectures are employed that are designed to embed the physical characteristics of the task directly into the network structure. We demonstrate the performance of the tool across a range of decay topologies, showing that the networks can correctly model the relationships between complex variables. The architectures and methods presented are generic and could readily be adapted to emulate workflows at other simulation-intensive particle physics experiments.

  abstract: "Measurements of integrated and differential cross-sections for W$^{±}$Z production in proton-proton collisions are presented. The data collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider from 2015 to 2018 at a centre-of-mass energy of $ \\sqrt{s}=13 $ TeV are used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{−1}$. The W$^{±}$Z candidate events are reconstructed using leptonic decay modes of the gauge bosons into electrons or muons. The integrated cross-section per lepton flavour for the production of W$^{±}$Z is measured in the detector fiducial region with a relative precision of 4%. The measured value is compared with the Standard Model prediction at a precision of up to next-to-next-to-leading-order in QCD and next-to-leading-order in electroweak. Cross-sections for W$^{+}$Z and W$^{−}$Z production and their ratio are presented. The W$^{±}$Z production is also measured differentially as functions of various kinematic variables, including new observables sensitive to CP-violation effects. All measurements are compared with state-of-the-art Standard Model predictions from fixed-order calculations or Monte Carlo generators based on next-to-leading-order matrix elements interfaced with parton showers. An effective field theory interpretation of the measurements is performed, considering both CP-conserving and CP-violating dimension-6 operators modifying the W$^{±}$Z production. In the absence of observed deviations from the Standard Model, limits on CP-conserving Wilson coefficients are extracted using the transverse mass of the W$^{±}$Z system. For CP-violating coefficients a machine learning approach is used to construct an observable with enhanced sensitivity to CP-violation effects.[graphic not available: see fulltext]"

  abstract: "A measurement of the top-quark pole mass $ {m}_t^{\\textrm{pole}} $ is presented in $ t\\overline{t} $ events with an additional jet, $ t\\overline{t} $ + 1-jet, produced in pp collisions at $ \\sqrt{s}=13 $ TeV. The data sample, recorded with the ATLAS experiment during Run 2 of the LHC, corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{−1}$. Events with one electron and one muon of opposite electric charge in the final state are selected to measure the $ t\\overline{t} $ + 1-jet differential cross-section as a function of the inverse of the invariant mass of the $ t\\overline{t} $ + 1-jet system. Iterative Bayesian Unfolding is used to correct the data to enable comparison with fixed-order calculations at next-to-leading-order accuracy in the strong coupling. The process $ pp\\to t\\overline{t}j\\left(2\\to 3\\right) $, where top quarks are taken as stable particles, and the process $ pp\\to b\\overline{b}{l}^{+}\\nu {l}^{-}\\overline{\\nu}j\\left(2\\to 7\\right) $, which includes top-quark decays to the dilepton final state and off-shell effects, are considered. The top-quark mass is extracted using a χ$^{2}$ fit of the unfolded normalized differential cross-section distribution. The results obtained with the 2 → 3 and 2 → 7 calculations are compatible within theoretical uncertainties, providing an important consistency check. The more precise determination is obtained for the 2 → 3 measurement: $ {m}_t^{\\textrm{pole}}=170.7\\pm 0.3\\left(\\textrm{stat}.\\right)\\pm 1.4\\left(\\textrm{syst}.\\right)\\pm 0.3\\left(\\textrm{scale}\\right)\\pm 0.2\\left(\\textrm{PDF}\\oplus {\\alpha}_{\\textrm{S}}\\right) $ GeV, which is in good agreement with other top-quark mass results.[graphic not available: see fulltext]"

  abstract: We address the inverse problem in Type IIB flux compactifications of identifying flux vacua with targeted phenomenological properties such as specific superpotential values or tadpole constraints using conditional generative models. These machine learning techniques overcome computational bottlenecks in traditional approaches such as rejection sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which struggle to generate rare, finely-tuned vacua. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that conditional generative models provide a more efficient alternative, specifically using conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs). We introduce a CVAE framework tailored to flux compactifications, incorporating physical constraints directly into the loss function - enabling the generation of physically consistent vacua beyond the training set. Our experiments on conifold and symmetric torus background geometries show that the CVAE achieves a speedup of about $O(10^3)$ compared to Metropolis sampling, particularly in narrow target ranges for superpotential values. Additionally, the CVAE generates novel, distinct flux configurations beyond the training data, highlighting its potential for probing computationally challenging regions of the string landscape. Our results establish conditional generative models as a powerful and scalable tool for targeted flux vacua generation, opening new pathways for model building in regions of the landscape previously inaccessible by traditional model building techniques.

  abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to detect thousands of individually resolved gravitational wave sources, overlapping in time and frequency, on top of unresolved astrophysical and/or primordial backgrounds. Disentangling resolved sources from backgrounds and extracting their parameters in a computationally intensive “global fit” is normally regarded as a necessary step toward reconstructing the properties of the underlying astrophysical populations. Here, we show that it is in principle feasible to infer the population properties of the most numerous of LISA sources—Galactic double white dwarfs—directly from the frequency (or, equivalently, time) strain series by adopting a simulation-based approach, without extracting and estimating the parameters of each single source. By training a normalizing flow on a custom-designed compression of simulated LISA frequency series from the Galactic double white dwarf population, we demonstrate how to infer the posterior distribution of population parameters (e.g., mass function, frequency, and spatial distributions). This allows for extracting information on the population parameters from both resolved and unresolved sources simultaneously and in a computationally efficient manner. This approach can be extended to other source classes (e.g., massive and stellar-mass black holes, extreme mass ratio inspirals) and to scenarios involving non-Gaussian or nonstationary noise (e.g., data gaps), provided that fast and accurate simulations are available.

  abstract: Simulating showers of particles in highly-granularcalorimeters is a key frontier in the application of machinelearning to particle physics. Achieving high accuracy and speed withgenerative machine learning models can enable them to augmenttraditional simulations and alleviate a major computing constraint.Recent developments have shown how diffusion based generative showersimulation approaches that do not rely on a fixed structure, butinstead generate geometry-independent point clouds, are veryefficient. We present a transformer-based extension to previousarchitectures which were developed for simulating electromagneticshowers in the highly granular electromagnetic calorimeter of theInternational Large Detector, ILD. The attention mechanism nowallows us to generate complex hadronic showers with more pronouncedsubstructure across both the electromagnetic and hadroniccalorimeters. This is the first time that machine learning methodsare used to holistically generate showers across the electromagneticand hadronic calorimeter in highly granular imaging calorimetersystems.

Nevertheless, a direct reconstruction of the timeline of the EoR in terms of the progress of ionization remains an ongoing challenge due to the highly non-Gaussian nature and thus intractable likelihood of the 21cm signal.Here, we present EoRFlow, a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework for reconstructing the global neutral hydrogen fraction x$_{HI}$(z) directly from 2D cylindrically averaged power spectra (2DPS) of the 21cm signal.We validate our method on realistic mock datasets for SKA-Low.Bypassing the need for explicit likelihood formulations, our approach enables fast, unbiased posterior estimation of the x$_{HI}$ evolution in narrow redshift slices, allowing for piecewise reconstruction of the global reionization history. By directly inferring the reionization history from 21cm power spectra, our framework provides a scalable and robust path forward for 21cm cosmology in the SKA era.

  abstract: For many fundamental physics applications, transformers, as the state of the art in learning complex correlations, benefit from pretraining on quasi-out-of-domain data. The obvious question is whether we can exploit Large Language Models, requiring proper out-of-domain transfer learning. We show how the Qwen2.5 LLM can be used to analyze and generate SKA data, specifically 3D maps of the cosmological large-scale structure for a large part of the observable Universe. We combine the LLM with connector networks and show, for cosmological parameter regression and lightcone generation, that this Lightcone LLM (L3M) with Qwen2.5 weights outperforms standard initialization and compares favorably with dedicated networks of matching size.

  abstract: The field of high energy physics (HEPs) has seen a marked increase in the use of machine learning (ML) techniques in recent years. The proliferation of applications has revolutionised many aspects of the data processing pipeline at collider experiments including the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this whitepaper, we discuss the increasingly crucial role that ML plays in real-time analysis (RTA) at the LHC, namely in the context of the unique challenges posed by the trigger systems of the large LHC experiments. We describe a small selection of the ML applications in use at the large LHC experiments to demonstrate the breadth of use-cases. We continue by emphasising the importance of collaboration and engagement between the HEP community and industry, highlighting commonalities and synergies between the two. The mutual benefits are showcased in several interdisciplinary examples of RTA from industrial contexts. This whitepaper, compiled by the SMARTHEP network, does not provide an exhaustive review of ML at the LHC but rather offers a high-level overview of specific real-time use cases.

  abstract: Neural simulation-based inference (NSBI) is a powerful class of machine-learning-based methods for statistical inference that naturally handles high-dimensional parameter estimation without the need to bin data into low-dimensional summary histograms. Such methods are promising for a range of measurements, including at the Large Hadron Collider, where no single observable may be optimal to scan over the entire theoretical phase space under consideration, or where binning data into histograms could result in a loss of sensitivity. This work develops a NSBI framework for statistical inference, using neural networks to estimate probability density ratios, which enables the application to a full-scale analysis. It incorporates a large number of systematic uncertainties, quantifies the uncertainty due to the finite number of events in training samples, develops a method to construct confidence intervals, and demonstrates a series of intermediate diagnostic checks that can be performed to validate the robustness of the method. As an example, the power and feasibility of the method are assessed on simulated data for a simplified version of an off-shell Higgs boson couplings measurement in the four-lepton final states. This approach represents an extension to the standard statistical methodology used by the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider, and can benefit many physics analyses.

  abstract: "We present an extension of the pop-cosmos model for the evolving galaxy population up to redshift z\_∼\_6. The model is trained on distributions of observed colors and magnitudes, from 26-band photometry of ∼420,000 galaxies in the COSMOS2020 catalog with Spitzer IRAC Channel 1\_<\_26 mag. The generative model includes a flexible distribution over 16 stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameters, and a depth-dependent photometric uncertainty model, both represented using score-based diffusion models. We use the trained model to predict scaling relationships for the galaxy population, such as the stellar mass function, star-forming main sequence, and gas phase and stellar metallicity versus mass relations, demonstrating reasonable to excellent agreement with previously published results. We explore the connection between mid-infrared emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star formation rate, finding high AGN activity for galaxies above the star-forming main sequence at 1\_≲\_z\_≲\_2. Using the trained population model as a prior distribution, we perform inference of the redshifts and SPS parameters for 429,669 COSMOS2020 galaxies, including 39,588 with publicly available spectroscopic redshifts. The resulting redshift estimates exhibit minimal bias (median[Δ$_{z}$]\_=\_−8\_×\_10$^{−4}$), scatter (σ$_{MAD}$\_=\_0.0132), and outlier fraction (6.19%) for the full 0\_<\_z\_<\_6 spectroscopic compilation. These results establish that pop-cosmos can achieve the accuracy and realism needed to forward model modern wide, deep surveys for Stage IV cosmology. We publicly release pop-cosmos software, mock galaxy catalogs, and COSMOS2020 redshift and SPS parameter posteriors."

  abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are effective for processing graph-structured data but face challenges with large graphs due to high memory requirements and inefficient sparse matrix operations on GPUs. Quantum computing offers a promising avenue to address these issues and inspires new algorithmic approaches. In particular, quantum GNNs (QGNNs) have been explored in recent literature. However, current quantum hardware limits the dimension of the data that can be effectively encoded. Existing approaches either simplify datasets manually or use artificial graph datasets. This work introduces the guided graph compression (GGC) framework, which uses a graph autoencoder to reduce both the number of nodes and the dimensionality of node features. The compression is guided to enhance the performance of a downstream classification task, which can be applied either with a quantum or a classical classifier. The framework is evaluated on the Jet Tagging task, a classification problem of fundamental importance in high energy physics that involves distinguishing particle jets initiated by quarks from those by gluons. We compare GGC to a model that uses the autoencoder as a preprocessing step and to a baseline classical GNN classifier. Our numerical results demonstrate that GGC outperforms both alternatives, while also facilitating the testing of novel QGNN ansatzes on realistic datasets.

  abstract: "Several new physics models including versions of supersymmetry (SUSY) characterized by R-parity violation (RPV) or with additional hidden sectors predict the production of events with top quarks, low missing transverse momentum, and many additional quarks or gluons. The results of a search for top squarks decaying to two top quarks and six additional light-flavor quarks or gluons are reported. The search employs a novel machine learning method for background estimation from control samples in data using decorrelated discriminators. The search is performed using events with 0, 1, or 2 electrons or muons in conjunction with at least six jets. No requirement is placed on the magnitude of the missing transverse momentum. The result is based on a sample of proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV corresponding to 138 fb$^{−1}$ of integrated luminosity collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016–2018. With no statistically significant excess of events observed beyond the expected contributions from the standard model, the data are used to determine upper limits on the top squark pair production cross section in the frameworks of RPV and stealth SUSY. Models with top squark masses less than 700 (930) GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level for RPV (stealth) SUSY scenarios.[graphic not available: see fulltext]"

  abstract: A novel solution is presented for the problem of estimating the backgrounds of a signal search using observed data while simultaneously maximizing the sensitivity of the search to the signal. The ``ABCD method'' provides a reliable framework for background estimation by partitioning events into one signal-enhanced region (A) and three background-enhanced control regions (B, C, and D) via two statistically independent variables. In practice, even slight correlations between the two variables can significantly undermine the method's performance. Thus, choosing appropriate variables by hand can present a formidable challenge, especially when background and signal differ only subtly. To address this issue, the ABCD with distance correlation (ABCDisCo) method was developed to construct two artificial variables from the output scores of a neural network trained to maximize signal-background discrimination while minimizing correlations using the distance correlation measure. However, relying solely on minimizing the distance correlation can yield undesirable characteristics in the resulting distributions, which may compromise the validity of the background prediction obtained using this method. The ABCDisCo training enhanced with closure (ABCDisCoTEC) method is introduced to solve this issue by directly minimizing the nonclosure, expressed as a dedicated differentiable loss term. This extended method is applied to a data set of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded by the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. Additionally, given the complexity of the minimization problem with constraints on multiple loss terms, the modified differential method of multipliers is applied and shown to greatly improve the stability and robustness of the ABCDisCoTEC method, compared to grid search hyperparameter optimization procedures.

  abstract: The R3B experiment at FAIR studies nuclear reactions using high-energy radioactive beams. One key detector in R3B is the CALIFA calorimeter consisting of 2544 CsI(Tl) scintillator crystals designed to detect light charged particles and gamma rays with an energy resolution in the per cent range after Doppler correction. Precise cluster reconstruction from sparse hit patterns is a crucial requirement. Standard algorithms typically use fixed cluster sizes or geometric thresholds. To enhance performance, advanced machine learning techniques such as agglomerative clustering were implemented to use the full multi-dimensional parameter space including geometry, energy and time of individual interactions. An Edge Detection Neural Network exhibited significant differences. This study, based on Geant4 simulations, demonstrates improvements in cluster reconstruction efficiency of more than 30%, showcasing the potential of machine learning in nuclear physics experiments.

  abstract: "The distribution of 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen is a powerful cosmological and astrophysical probe, as it traces the underlying dark matter and cold gas distributions throughout cosmic times. However, the prediction of observable signals is hindered by the large computational costs of the required hydrodynamic simulations. We introduce a novel machine learning pipeline that, once trained on a hydrodynamical simulation, is able to generate both halo mass density maps and the three-dimensional 21 cm brightness temperature signal, starting from a dark matter-only simulation. We use an attention-based ResUNet (HALOgen) to predict dark matter halo maps, which are then processed through a trained conditional variational diffusion model (LODI) to produce 21 cm brightness temperature maps. LODI is trained on smaller sub-volumes that are then seamlessly combined in 512-times larger volume using a new method, called ‘latent overlap’. We demonstrate that, once trained on 253 \_(Mpc/h)3 volume simulations, we are able to predict the 21 cm power spectrum on an unseen dark matter map (with the same cosmology) to within 10 per cent for wavenumbers k≤10\_h~Mpc−1⁠, deep inside the non-linear regime, with a computational effort of the order of two minutes. While demonstrated on this specific volume, our approach is designed to be scalable to arbitrarily large simulations."

  abstract: The efficient simulation of multijet final states presents a serious computational task for analyses of LHC data and will be even more so at the HL-LHC. We here discuss means to accelerate the generation of unweighted events based on a two-stage rejection-sampling algorithm that employs neural-network surrogates for unweighting the hard-process matrix elements. To this end, we generalise the previously proposed algorithm based on factorisation-aware neural networks to the case of multijet merging at tree-level accuracy. We thereby account for several non-trivial aspects of realistic event-simulation setups, including biased phase-space sampling, partial unweighting, and the mapping of partonic subprocesses. We apply our methods to the production of Z+jets final states at the HL-LHC using the Sherpa event generator, including matrix elements with up to six final-state partons. When using neural-network surrogates for the dominant Z+5 jets and Z+6 jets partonic processes, we find a reduction in the total event-generation time by more than a factor of 10 compared to baseline Sherpa.

  abstract: "Context. Feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei (AGN) shapes the galaxy formation and evolution, but its impact remains unclear. Galaxy groups offer a crucial probe to determine this impact because their gravitational binding energy is comparable to the energy that is available from their central AGN. The XMM-Newton Group AGN Project (X-GAP) is a sample of 49 groups that were selected in the X-ray (ROSAT) and optical (SDSS) bands and provides a benchmark for hydrodynamical simulations.Aims. For this comparison, it is essential to understand the selection effects. We model the selection function of X-GAP by forward-modelling the detection process in the X-ray and optical bands.Methods. Using the Uchuu N-body simulation, we built a dark matter halo light cone, predicted X-ray group properties with a neural network trained on hydrodynamical simulations, and assigned matching observed properties to the galaxies. We compared the selected sample to the parent population in the light cone.Results. Our method provided a sample that matched the observed distribution of the X-ray luminosity and velocity dispersion. A completeness of 50% was reached at a velocity dispersion of 450 km/s in the X-GAP redshift range. The selection is driven by X-ray flux, with a secondary dependence on the velocity dispersion and redshift. We estimated a purity level of 93% for the X-GAP parent sample. We calibrated the relation of the velocity dispersion to the halo mass. We found a normalisation and slope that agree with the literature and an intrinsic scatter of about 0.06 dex. The measured velocity dispersion is only accurate within 10% for rich systems with more than about 20 members, and the velocity dispersion for groups with fewer than 10 members is biased at more than 20%.Conclusions. The X-ray follow-up refines the optical selection and enhances the purity, but reduces completeness. In an SDSS-like set-up, measurement errors for the velocity dispersion dominate the intrinsic scatter. Our selection model enables unbiased comparisons of thermodynamic properties and gas fractions between X-GAP groups and hydrodynamical simulations.Key words: methods: data analysis / surveys / galaxies: clusters: intracluster medium / galaxies: groups: general / large-scale structure of Universe / X-rays: galaxies: clusters"

  abstract: Geoff is a collection of Python packages that form a framework for automation of particle accelerator controls. With particle accelerator laboratories around the world researching machine learning techniques to improve accelerator performance and uptime, a multitude of approaches and algorithms have emerged. The purpose of Geoff is to harmonize these approaches and to minimize friction when comparing or migrating between them. It provides standardized interfaces for optimization problems, utility functions to speed up development, and a reference GUI application that ties everything together. Geoff is an open-source library developed at CERN and maintained and updated in collaboration between CERN and GSI as part of the EURO-LABS project. This paper gives an overview over Geoff's design, features, and current usage.

  abstract: The pursuit of discovering new phenomena at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) requires constant innovation in algorithms and technologies. Tensor networks are mathematical models at the intersection of classical and quantum machine learning, which present a promising and efficient alternative for tackling these challenges. In this study, we propose a tensor network-based strategy for anomaly detection at the LHC and demonstrate its superior performance in identifying new phenomena compared to established quantum methods. Our model is a parameterized matrix product state with an isometric feature map, processing a latent representation of simulated LHC data generated by an autoencoder. Our results highlight the potential of tensor networks to enhance new-physics discovery.

  abstract: A search for the violation of the charge-parity ($CP$) symmetry in the production of top quarks in association with Z bosons is presented, using events with at least three charged leptons and additional jets. The search is performed in a sample of proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2016$-$2018 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and in 2022 at 13.6 TeV, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 173 fb$^{-1}$. For the first time in this final state, observables that are odd under the $CP$ transformation are employed. Also for the first time, physics-informed machine-learning techniques are used to construct these observables. While for standard model (SM) processes the distributions of these observables are predicted to be symmetric around zero, $CP$-violating modifications of the SM would introduce asymmetries. Two $CP$-odd operators $\mathcal{O}_\text{tW}^\text{I}$ and $\mathcal{O}_\text{tZ}^\text{I}$ in the SM effective field theory are considered that may modify the interactions between top quarks and electroweak bosons. The obtained results are consistent with the SM prediction within two standard deviations, and exclusion limits on the associated Wilson coefficients of $-$2.7 $\lt$$c_\text{tW}^\text{I}$$\lt$ 2.5 and $-$0.2 $\lt$$c_\text{tZ}^\text{I}$$\lt$ 2.0 are set at 95% confidence level. The largest discrepancy is observed in $c_\text{tZ}^\text{I}$ where data is consistent with positive values, with an observed local significance with respect to the SM hypothesis of 2.5 standard deviations, when only linear terms are considered.

  abstract: Transformer networks excel in scientific applications. We explore two scenarios in ultra-high-energy cosmic ray simulations to examine what these network architectures learn. First, we investigate the trained positional encodings in air showers which are azimuthally symmetric. Second, we visualize the attention values assigned to cosmic particles originating from a galaxy catalog. In both cases, the Transformers learn plausible, physically meaningful features.

  abstract: Jet flavour tagging enables the identification of jets originating from heavy-flavour quarks in proton–proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, playing a critical role in its physics programmes. This paper presents GN2, a transformer-based flavour tagging algorithm deployed by the ATLAS Collaboration that represents a different methodology compared to previous approaches. Designed to classify jets based on the flavour of their constituent particles, GN2 processes low-level tracking information in an end-to-end architecture and incorporates physics-informed auxiliary training objectives to enhance both interpretability and performance. Its performance is validated in both simulation and collision data. The measured c-jet (light-jet) rejection in data is improved by a factor of 3.5 (1.8) for a 70% b-jet tagging efficiency, compared to the previous algorithm. GN2 provides substantial benefits for physics analyses involving heavy-flavour jets, such as measurements of Higgs boson pair production and the couplings of bottom and charm quarks to the Higgs boson, and demonstrates the impact of advanced machine learning methods in experimental particle physics.

  abstract: Lorentz-equivariant neural networks are becoming the leading architectures for high-energy physics. Current implementations rely on specialized layers, limiting architectural choices. We introduce Lorentz Local Canonicalization (LLoCa), a general framework that renders any backbone network exactly Lorentz-equivariant. Using equivariantly predicted local reference frames, we construct LLoCa-transformers and graph networks. We adapt a recent approach for geometric message passing to the non-compact Lorentz group, allowing propagation of space-time tensorial features. Data augmentation emerges from LLoCa as a special choice of reference frame. Our models achieve competitive and state-of-the-art accuracy on relevant particle physics tasks, while being $4\times$ faster and using $10\times$ fewer FLOPs.

  abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals pose a difficult challenge in terms of both search and parameter estimation for upcoming space-based gravitational-wave detectors such as LISA. Their signals are long and of complex morphology, meaning they carry a large amount of information about their source, but are also difficult to search for and analyse. We explore how sequential simulation-based inference methods, specifically truncated marginal neural ratio estimation, could offer solutions to some of the challenges surrounding extreme-mass-ratio inspiral data analysis. We show that this method can efficiently narrow down the volume of the complex 11-dimensional search parameter space by a factor of $10^6-10^7$ and provide 1-dimensional marginal proposal distributions for non-spinning extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. We discuss the current limitations of this approach and place it in the broader context of a global strategy for future space-based gravitational-wave data analysis.

  abstract: A calibration of the ATLAS flavour-tagging algorithms using a new calibration procedure based on optimal transportation maps is presented. Simultaneous, continuous corrections to the b-jet, c-jet, and light-flavour jet classification probabilities from jet-tagging algorithms in simulation are derived for b-jets using $t\bar{t} \rightarrow e\mu \nu \nu bb$ data. After application of the derived calibration maps, closure between simulation and observation is achieved for jet flavour observables used in ATLAS analyses of Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Run 2 proton-proton collision data. This continuous calibration opens up new possibilities for the future use of jet flavour information in LHC analyses and also serves as a guide for deriving high-dimensional corrections to simulation via transportation maps, an important development for a broad range of inference tasks.

  abstract: We showcase the application of neural importance sampling for the evaluation of NNLO QCD scattering cross sections. We consider Normalizing Flows in the form of discrete Coupling Layers and time continuous flows for the integration of the various cross-section contributions when using the sector-improved residue subtraction scheme. We thereby consider the stratification of the integrands into their positive and negative contributions, and separately optimize the phase-space sampler. We exemplify the novel methods for the case of gluonic top-quark pair production at the LHC at NNLO QCD accuracy. We find significant gains with respect to the current default methods used in STRIPPER in terms of reduced cross-section variances and increased unweighting efficiencies. In turn, the computational costs for evaluations of the integrand needed to achieve a certain statistical uncertainty for the cross section can be reduced by a factor 8.

  abstract: Overlapping signals represent one of the major data analysis challenges in next-generation gravitational wave detectors. We leverage Transformers and Normalizing Flows, state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, to address the parameter estimation of overlapping binary black hole mergers in the Einstein telescope (ET). Our proposed model combines a Transformer-based ‘Knowledge Extractor Neural Network’ (KENN ) with a Normalizing Flow (HYPERION ) to perform rapid and unbiased inference over multiple overlapping black hole binary events. The choice of architecture leverages the strength of Transformers in capturing complex and long-range temporal structures in the strain time series data, while Normalizing Flows provide a powerful framework to sample posterior distributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our model over simulated gravitational wave signals, showing that it maintains the same level of accuracy regardless of the correlation level in the data. Moreover our model provides estimates of chirp mass and coalescence times within ${\lesssim}10\%$–20% from the true simulated value. The results obtained are promising and show how this approach might represent a first step toward a deep-learning based inference pipeline for ET and other future gravitational wave detectors.

  abstract: "Over the past 16\_years, the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has significantly advanced our view of the GeV gamma-ray sky, yet several key questions remain—such as the composition of the isotropic gamma-ray background, the origin of the Fermi Bubbles, or the potential presence of signatures from exotic physics like dark matter. Addressing these challenges requires sophisticated astrophysical modeling and robust statistical methods capable of handling high-dimensional parameter spaces. In this work, we analyze 14\_years of high-latitude (<math display=\"inline\"><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mi>b</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mo>≥</mo><mn>3</mn><mn>0</mn><mi>°</mi></math>) Fermi-LAT data in the range from 1 to 10\_GeV using simulation-based inference (SBI) via neural ratio estimation. This approach allows us to detect individual gamma-ray sources and derive a list of significant gamma-ray emitters containing more than 98% of all sources listed in the Fermi-LAT Fourth Source Catalog (4FGL) with a flux <math display=\"inline\"><mi>S</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>×</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>10</mn></mrow></msup><mtext> </mtext><mtext> </mtext><msup><mrow><mi>cm</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup><mtext> </mtext><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">s</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></math> (about a factor of 3 larger than the flux above which 4FGL is nearly complete), without any non-4FGL source detected in that flux range. Additionally, we reconstruct the source-count distribution in both parametric and nonparametric forms, achieving large agreement with previous literature results as well as those sources detected by our SBI pipeline. We also quantitatively validate our gamma-ray emission simulator via an anomaly detection technique, demonstrating that the synthetic data closely reproduce the complexity of the real observations."

The ATLAS experiment dataset collected at the Large Hadron Collider from 2015 to 2018 is used, consisting of proton-proton collisions at <math display="inline"><msqrt><mi>s</mi></msqrt><mo>=</mo><mn>13</mn><mtext> </mtext><mtext> </mtext><mi>TeV</mi></math> and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of <math display="inline"><mn>140</mn><mtext> </mtext><mtext> </mtext><msup><mi>fb</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></math>. The <math display="inline"><msup><mi>Z</mi><mo>′</mo></msup></math> mediator is considered to decay to two dark quarks, which each hadronize and decay to showers containing both dark and Standard Model particles, producing a topology of interacting and noninteracting particles within a jet known as “semivisible.” Machine learning methods are used to select these dark showers and reject the dominant background of mismeasured multijet events, including an anomaly detection approach to preserve broad sensitivity to a variety of BSM topologies. A resonance search is performed by fitting the transverse mass spectrum based on a functional form background estimation. No significant excess over the expected background is observed. Results are presented as limits on the production cross section of semivisible jet signals, parametrized by the fraction of invisible particles in the decay and the <math display="inline"><msup><mi>Z</mi><mo>′</mo></msup></math> mass, and by quantifying the significance of any generic Gaussian-shaped mass peak in the anomaly region.

  abstract: Gravitational wave data are often contaminated by non-Gaussian noise transients, “glitches,” which can bias the inference of astrophysical signal parameters. Traditional approaches either subtract glitches in a preprocessing step, or a glitch model can be included from an agnostic wavelet basis (e.g., BayesWave). In this work, we introduce a machine-learning-based approach to build a parametrized model of glitches. We train a normalizing flow on known glitches from the Gravity Spy catalog, constructing an informative prior on the glitch model. By incorporating this model into the Bayesian inference analysis with bilby, we estimate glitch and signal parameters simultaneously. We demonstrate the performance of our method through bias reduction, glitch identification, and Bayesian model selection on real glitches. Our results show that this approach effectively removes glitches from the data, significantly improving source parameter estimation and reducing bias.

  abstract: The growing luminosity frontier at the Large Hadron Collider is challenging the reconstruction and analysis of particle collision events. Increased particle multiplicities are straining latency and storage requirements at the data acquisition stage, while new complications are emerging, including higher background levels and more frequent particle vertex misassociations. This in turn necessitates the development of more holistic and scalable reconstruction methods that take advantage of recent advances in machine learning. We propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) architecture featuring unique representations for diverse particle collision relationships and integrated graph pruning layers for scalability. Trained with a multi-task paradigm in an environment mimicking the LHCb experiment, this HGNN significantly improves the beauty hadron reconstruction performance. Notably, it concurrently performs particle vertex association and graph pruning within a single framework. We quantify the reconstruction and pruning performance, demonstrate enhanced inference time scaling with event complexity, and mitigate potential performance loss using a weighted message passing scheme.

  abstract: The Einstein Telescope (ET), along with other third-generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors, will be a key instrument for detecting GWs in the coming decades. However, analyzing the data and estimating source parameters will be challenging, especially given the large number of expected detections—on the order of <math display="inline"><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>5</mn></msup></math> per year—which make current methods based on stochastic sampling impractical. In this work, we use dingo-is to perform neural posterior estimation (NPE) of high-redshift events detectable with ET in its triangular configuration. NPE is a likelihood-free inference technique that leverages normalizing flows to approximate posterior distributions. After training, inference is fast, requiring only a few minutes per source, and accurate, as corrected through importance sampling and validated against standard Bayesian inference methods. To confirm previous findings on the ability to estimate parameters for high-redshift sources with ET, we compare NPE results with predictions from the Fisher information matrix (FIM) approximation. We find that NPE correctly recovers the eight degenerate sky modes induced by the triangular detector geometry, missed by the FIM analysis, resulting in an underestimation of sky localization uncertainties for most sources. FIM also overestimates the uncertainty in luminosity distance by a factor of <math display="inline"><mo>∼</mo><mn>3</mn></math> on average when the injected luminosity distance is <math display="inline"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">L</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>inj</mi></mrow></msubsup><mo>&gt;</mo><msup><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>5</mn></mrow></msup><mtext> </mtext><mtext> </mtext><mi>Mpc</mi></mrow></math>, further confirming that ET will be particularly well suited for studying the early Universe.

  abstract: Numerical simulations of quantum field theories on lattices serve as a fundamental tool for studying the non-perturbative regime of the theories, where analytic tools often fall short. Challenges arise when one takes the continuum limit or as the system approaches a critical point, especially in the presence of non-trivial topological structures in the theory. Rapid recent advances in machine learning provide a promising avenue for progress in this area. These lecture notes aim to give a brief account of lattice field theories, normalizing flows, and how the latter can be applied to study the former. The notes are based on the lectures given by the first author in various recent research schools.

  abstract: Radiometers are crucial instruments in radio astronomy, forming the primary component of nearly all radio telescopes. They measure the intensity of electromagnetic radiation, converting this radiation into electrical signals. A radiometer’s primary components are an antenna and a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA), which is the core of the “receiver” chain. Instrumental effects introduced by the receiver are typically corrected or removed during calibration. However, impedance mismatches between the antenna and receiver can introduce unwanted signal reflections and distortions. Traditional calibration methods, such as Dicke switching, alternate the receiver input between the antenna and a well-characterised reference source to mitigate errors by comparison. Recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) offer promising alternatives. Neural networks, which are trained using known signal sources, provide a powerful means to model and calibrate complex systems where traditional analytical approaches struggle. These methods are especially relevant for detecting the faint sky-averaged 21-cm signal from atomic hydrogen at high redshifts. This is one of the main challenges in observational Cosmology today. Here, for the first time, we introduce and test a machine learning-based calibration framework capable of achieving the precision required for radiometric experiments aiming to detect the 21-cm line.

  abstract: "Extracting continuum properties of quantum field theories from discretized spacetime is challenging due to lattice artifacts. Renormalization-group (RG)-improved lattice actions can preserve continuum properties, but are in general difficult to parameterize. Machine learning (ML) with gauge-equivariant convolutional neural networks provides a way to efficiently describe such actions. We test a machine-learned RG-improved lattice gauge action, the classically perfect fixed-point (FP) action, for four-dimensional SU(3) gauge theory through Monte\_Carlo simulations. We establish that the gradient flow of the FP action is free of tree-level discretization effects to all orders in the lattice spacing, making it classically perfect. This allows us to test the quality of improvement of the FP action, without introducing additional artifacts. We find that discretization effects in gradient-flow observables are highly suppressed and less than 1% up to lattice spacings of 0.14\_fm, allowing continuum physics to be extracted from coarse lattices. The quality of improvement achieved motivates the use of the FP action in future gauge theory studies. The advantages of ML-based parameterizations also highlight the possibility of realizing quantum perfect actions in lattice gauge theory."

  abstract: "We present a refined version of the Anomaly Awareness framework for enhancing unsupervised anomaly detection. Our approach introduces minimal supervision into Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) through a two-stage training strategy: the model is first trained in an unsupervised manner on background data, and then fine-tuned using a small sample of labeled anomalies to encourage larger reconstruction errors for anomalous samples. We validate the method across diverse domains, including the MNIST dataset with synthetic anomalies, network intrusion data from the CICIDS benchmark, collider physics data from the LHCO2020 dataset, and simulated events from the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The latter provides a realistic example of subtle kinematic deviations in Higgs boson production. In all cases, the model demonstrates improved sensitivity to unseen anomalies, achieving better separation between normal and anomalous samples. These results indicate that even limited anomaly information, when incorporated through targeted fine-tuning, can substantially improve the generalization and performance of unsupervised models for anomaly detection."

  abstract: The abundance of galaxy clusters as a function of mass and redshift is a well-established and powerful cosmological probe. Cosmological analyses based on galaxy cluster number counts have traditionally relied on explicitly computed likelihoods, which are often challenging to develop with the required accuracy and expensive to evaluate. In this work, we implement an alternative approach based on simulation-based inference (SBI) methods that relies solely on synthetic galaxy cluster catalogs generated under a given model. These catalogs are much easier to produce than it is to develop and validate a likelihood. We validate this approach in the context of the galaxy cluster survey of the upcoming Simons Observatory for a setup in which we can also evaluate an exact explicit likelihood. We find that our SBI-based approach yields cosmological parameter posterior means that are within <math display="inline"><mn>0.2</mn><mi>σ</mi></math> of those obtained with the explicit likelihood and with biases smaller than <math display="inline"><mn>0.1</mn><mi>σ</mi></math>. We also introduce and validate a procedure to assess the goodness of fit using only synthetic catalogs similar to those used for training. This demonstrates, for the first time, that a galaxy cluster number count cosmological analysis can be performed fully without resorting to a likelihood at any stage. Finally, we apply our SBI-based approach to the real Planck MMF3 cosmology sample, obtaining cosmological parameter constraints that are within <math display="inline"><mn>0.1</mn><mi>σ</mi></math> of their likelihood-based counterparts. This constitutes the first SBI-based number count cosmological analysis of a real galaxy cluster catalog.

  abstract: "Observations of the Epoch of Reionization have the potential to answer long-standing questions of astrophysical interest regarding the nature of the first luminous sources and their effects on the intergalactic medium (IGM). We present astrophysical constraints from a Neural Density Estimation-Accelerated Bayesian joint analysis of constraints deriving from cosmic microwave background power spectrum measurements from Planck and South Pole Telescope, IGM neutral fraction measurements from Lyman line-based data sets, and 21-cm power spectrum upper limits from Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array, LOw Frequency ARray, and the Murchison Widefield Array. In the context of the model employed, the data are found to be consistent with galaxies forming from predominantly atomic-cooled hydrogen gas in dark matter haloes, with masses Mh≳2.6×109\_M⊙((1+z)/10)12 at 95 per cent credibility (⁠Vc≳50\_km\_s−1⁠) being the dominant galactic population driving reionization. These galaxies reionize the neutral hydrogen in the IGM over a narrow redshift interval (⁠Δzre<1.8 at 95 per cent credibility), with the mid-point of reionization constrained to z50=7.16−0.12+0.15⁠. We also obtain a tight constraint on the optical depth to reionization, τCMB=0.052±0.002⁠, disfavouring high-τCMB scenarios (⁠τCMB∼0.09⁠) proposed to ease Planck–Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument tensions. Given the parameter posteriors from our joint analysis, we find that the posterior predictive distribution of the global 21-cm signal is reduced in amplitude and shifted to lower redshifts relative to the model prior. We caution, however, that our inferences are model-dependent. Future work incorporating updated mass-dependent star formation efficiencies in atomic cooling haloes, informed by the latest UV luminosity function constraints from the James Webb Space Telescope, promises to refine these inferences further and enhance our understanding of cosmic reionization."

  abstract: A measurement of the atmospheric $\nu _{\mu }+\bar{\nu }_{\mu }$ flux with energies between 1 and 100 GeV is presented. The measurement has been performed using data taken with the first six detection units of the KM3NeT/ORCA detector, referred to as ORCA6. The data were collected between January 2020 and November 2021 and correspond to 510 days of livetime, with a total exposure of 433 kton$\cdot $years. Using machine learning classification, 3894 neutrino candidate events have been selected with an atmospheric muon contamination of less than 1$\%$. The atmospheric $\nu _{\mu }+\bar{\nu }_{\mu }$ energy spectrum is derived using an unfolding procedure and the impact of systematic uncertainties is estimated. The atmospheric $\nu _{\mu }+\bar{\nu }_{\mu }$ flux measured using the ORCA6 configuration is in agreement with the values measured by other experiments.

  abstract: "A search for charged-lepton flavour violation (CLFV) in top quark (t) production and decay is presented. The search uses proton-proton collision data corresponding to 138 fb$^{−1}$ collected with the CMS experiment at $\\sqrt{s}={13}$ TeV. The signal consists of the production of a single top quark via a CLFV interaction or top quark pair production followed by a CLFV decay. The analysis selects events containing a hadronically decaying τ lepton and a muon of opposite electric charge, as well as at least three jets, one of which is identified as originating from the fragmentation of a bottom quark. Machine learning classification techniques are used to distinguish signal from standard model background events. The results of this search are consistent with the standard model expectations. The upper limits at 95% confidence level on the branching fraction $\\mathcal{B}$ for CLFV top quark decays to a muon, a τ lepton, and an up or a charm quark are set at $\\mathcal{B}\\left({\\text{t}}\\to \\mu \\tau {\\text{u}}\\right)$ < (0.04, 0.08, and 0.12) × 10$^{−6}$, and $\\mathcal{B}\\left({\\text{t}}\\to \\mu \\tau {\\text{c}}\\right)$ < (0.81, 1.71, and 2.05) × 10$^{−6}$ for scalar, vector, and tensor-like operators, respectively.[graphic not available: see fulltext]"

  abstract: A measurement of off-shell Higgs boson production is performed in the H* → WW channel. The measurement uses a proton–proton collision dataset with an integrated luminosity of 140 fb<math altimg="si12.svg"><msup><mrow/><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></math> collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Final states in which both W bosons decay leptonically are targeted, and events are categorised based on the flavour of the final-state leptons, the jet multiplicity, and the output of neural network-based classifiers. The data are found to be compatible with the Standard Model expectation. An observed (expected) upper bound on the 95 % symmetric confidence level interval is set on the rate of off-shell Higgs boson production at a value of 3.4 (4.4) times the Standard Model prediction. These results are combined with the results from the measurement of on-shell Higgs boson production in the same final states to obtain an observed (expected) upper bound at 95 % confidence level on the Higgs boson total width of 13.1 (17.3) MeV.

  abstract: We investigate how symmetries present in datasets affect the structure of the latent space learned by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). By training VAEs on data originating from simple mechanical systems and particle collisions, we analyze the organization of the latent space through a relevance measure that identifies the most meaningful latent directions. We show that when symmetries or approximate symmetries are present, the VAE self-organizes its latent space, effectively compressing the data along a reduced number of latent variables. This behavior captures the intrinsic dimensionality determined by the symmetry constraints and reveals hidden relations among the features. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of a simple toy model, demonstrating how, under idealized conditions, the latent space aligns with the symmetry directions of the data manifold. We illustrate these findings with examples ranging from two-dimensional datasets with $O(2)$ symmetry to realistic datasets from electron-positron and proton-proton collisions. Our results highlight the potential of unsupervised generative models to expose underlying structures in data and offer a novel approach to symmetry discovery without explicit supervision.

  abstract: The increasing complexity of modern neural network architectures demands fast and memory-efficient implementations to mitigate computational bottlenecks. In this work, we evaluate the recently proposed BitNet architecture in HEP applications, assessing its performance in classification, regression, and generative modeling tasks. Specifically, we investigate its suitability for quark-gluon discrimination, SMEFT parameter estimation, and detector simulation, comparing its efficiency and accuracy to state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that while BitNet consistently performs competitively in classification tasks, its performance in regression and generation varies with the size and type of the network, highlighting key limitations and potential areas for improvement.

  abstract: Human activity continues to have an enormous negative impact on the ability of the planet to sustain human and other forms of life. Six out of the nine planetary boundaries have been crossed, a seventh is close to threshold. Prominent manifestations of this development are climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions, as well as loss of biodiversity. In recognition of the urgency of these problems, several international agreements have been ratified to achieve net-zero emissions and to halt and reverse biodiversity loss. Significant reductions in emissions are required by 2030 to meet international climate targets. The field of particle physics has an obligation and an opportunity to contribute to such mitigation efforts and to avoid causing further harm. This document urges the European Strategy Update in Particle Physics to set a clear and bold mandate for embedding environmental sustainability throughout the future scientific programme, and advocates for a series of actions that will enable this.

  abstract: Detecting localized density differences in multivariate data is a crucial task in computational science. Such anomalies can indicate a critical system failure, lead to a groundbreaking scientific discovery, or reveal unexpected changes in data distribution. We introduce EagleEye, an anomaly detection method to compare two multivariate datasets with the aim of identifying local density anomalies, namely over- or under-densities affecting only localised regions of the feature space. Anomalies are detected by modelling, for each point, the ordered sequence of its neighbours' membership label as a coin-flipping process and monitoring deviations from the expected behaviour of such process. A unique advantage of our method is its ability to provide an accurate, entirely unsupervised estimate of the local signal purity. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. In synthetic data, EagleEye accurately detects anomalies in multiple dimensions even when they affect a tiny fraction of the data. When applied to a challenging resonant anomaly detection benchmark task in simulated Large Hadron Collider data, EagleEye successfully identifies particle decay events present in just 0.3% of the dataset. In global temperature data, EagleEye uncovers previously unidentified, geographically localised changes in temperature fields that occurred in the most recent years. Thanks to its key advantages of conceptual simplicity, computational efficiency, trivial parallelisation, and scalability, EagleEye is widely applicable across many fields.

  abstract: Recent analyses of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from CAMELS have shown that machine learning models can predict the parameter describing the total matter content of the universe, Ω$_{m}$, from the features of a single galaxy. We investigate the statistical properties of two of these simulation suites, IllustrisTNG and ASTRID, confirming that Ω$_{m}$ induces a strong displacement on the distribution of galaxy features. We also observe that most other parameters have little to no effect on the distribution, except for the stellar-feedback parameter A$_{SN1}$, which introduces some near-degeneracies that can be broken with specific features. These two properties explain the predictability of Ω$_{m}$. We use optimal transport to further measure the effect of parameters on the distribution of galaxy properties, which is found to be consistent with physical expectations. However, we observe discrepancies between the two simulation suites, both in the effect of Ω$_{m}$ on the galaxy properties and in the distributions themselves at identical parameter values. Thus, although Ω$_{m}$’s signature can be easily detected within a given simulation suite using just a single galaxy, applying this result to real observational data may prove significantly more challenging.

  abstract: We extend the particle-flow neural assisted simulations (parnassus) framework of fast simulation and reconstruction to entire collider events. In particular, we use two generative artificial intelligence tools, continuous normalizing flows and diffusion models, to create a set of reconstructed particle-flow objects conditioned on truth-level particles from CMS Open Simulations. While previous work focused on jets, our updated methods now can accommodate all particle-flow objects in an event along with particle-level attributes like particle type and production vertex coordinates. This approach is fully automated, entirely written in Python, and GPU-compatible. Using a variety of physics processes at the LHC, we show that the extended parnassus is able to generalize beyond the training dataset and outperforms the standard, public tool delphes.

  abstract: We critically assess the robustness of uncertainties on parton distribution functions (PDFs) determined using neural networks from global sets of experimental data collected from multiple experiments. We view the determination of PDFs as an inverse problem, and we study the way the neural network model tackles it when inconsistencies between input datasets are present. We use a closure test approach, in which the regression model is applied to artificial data produced from a known underlying truth, to which the output of the model can be compared and its accuracy can be assessed in a statistically reliable way. We explore various phenomenologically relevant scenarios in which inconsistencies arise due to incorrect estimation of correlated systematic uncertainties. We show that the neural network generally corrects for the inconsistency except in cases of extreme uncertainty underestimation. When the inconsistency is not corrected, we propose and validate a procedure to detect inconsistencies.

  abstract: Supervised deep learning methods have been successful in the field of high energy physics, and the trend within the field is to move away from high level reconstructed variables to lower level, higher dimensional features. Supervised methods require labelled data, which is typically provided by a simulator. As the number of features increases, simulation accuracy decreases, leading to greater domain shift between training and testing data when using lower-level features. This work demonstrates that the classification without labels paradigm can be used to remove the need for background simulation when training supervised classifiers. This can result in classifiers with higher performance on real data than those trained on simulated data.

  abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming scientific research, with deep learning methods playing a central role in data analysis, simulations, and signal detection across particle, nuclear, and astroparticle physics. Within the JENA (Joint ECFA, NuPECC, APPEC) communities and as part of the European Coalition for AI in Fundamental Physics initiative, AI integration is advancing steadily. However, broader adoption remains constrained by challenges such as limited computational resources, a lack of expertise, and difficulties in transitioning from research and development to production. This white paper provides a strategic roadmap, informed by a community survey, to address these barriers. It outlines critical infrastructure requirements, prioritises training initiatives, and proposes funding strategies to scale AI capabilities across fundamental physics over the next five years.

  abstract: "We introduce a novel approach for end-to-end black-box optimization of high energy physics (HEP) detectors using local deep learning surrogates. These surrogates approximate a scalar objective function that encapsulates the complex interplay of particle-matter interactions and physics analysis goals. In addition to a standard reconstruction-based metric commonly used in the field, we investigate the information-theoretic metric of mutual information. In contrast to traditional methods, mutual information is inherently task-agnostic, offering a broader optimization paradigm that is less constrained by predefined targets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in a realistic physics analysis scenario: optimizing the thicknesses of calorimeter detector layers based on simulated particle interactions. The surrogate model learns to approximate objective gradients, enabling efficient optimization with respect to energy resolution. Our findings reveal three key insights: (1) end-to-end black-box optimization using local surrogates is a practical and compelling approach for detector design, providing direct optimization of detector parameters in alignment with physics analysis goals; (2) mutual information-based optimization yields design choices that closely match those from state-of-the-art physics-informed methods, indicating that these approaches operate near optimality and reinforcing their reliability in HEP detector design; and (3) information-theoretic methods provide a powerful, generalizable framework for optimizing scientific instruments. By reframing the optimization process through an information-theoretic lens rather than domain-specific heuristics, mutual information enables the exploration of new avenues for discovery beyond conventional approaches."

  abstract: "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title> <jats:p>Neural network emulators are widely used in astrophysics and cosmology to approximate complex simulations inside Bayesian inference loops. Ad hoc rules of thumb are often used to justify the emulator accuracy required for reliable posterior recovery. We provide a theoretically motivated limit on the maximum amount of incorrect information inferred by using an emulator with a given accuracy. Under assumptions of linearity in the model, uncorrelated noise in the data and a Gaussian-likelihood function, we demonstrate that the difference between the true underlying posterior and the recovered posterior can be quantified via a Kullback–Leibler divergence. We demonstrate how this limit can be used in the field of 21-cm cosmology by comparing the posteriors recovered when fitting mock data sets generated with the 1D radiative transfer code ares directly with the simulation code and separately with an emulator. This paper is partly in response to and builds upon recent discussions in the literature which call into question the use of emulators in Bayesian inference pipelines. Upon repeating some aspects of these analyses, we find these concerns quantitatively unjustified, with accurate posterior recovery possible even when the mean RMSE error for the emulator is approximately 20\_per cent of the magnitude of the noise in the data. For the purposes of community reproducibility, we make our analysis code public at this link https://github.com/htjb/validating_posteriors.</jats:p>"

  abstract: "How many simulations do we need to train machine learning methods to extract information available from summary statistics of the cosmological density field? Neural methods have shown the potential to extract nonlinear information available from cosmological data. To achieve this requires appropriate network architectures and a sufficient number of simulations for training the networks. This is the first detailed convergence study in which a neural network (NN) is trained to extract maximally informative summary statistics for cosmological inference. We show that currently available simulation suites, such as the Quijote Latin Hypercube with 2000 simulations, do not provide sufficient training data for a generic NN to reach the optimal regime. We present a case study in which we train a moment network to infer cosmological parameters from the nonlinear dark matter power spectrum, where the optimal information content can be computed through asymptotic analysis using the Cramér-Rao information bound. We find an empirical neural scaling law that predicts how much information a NN can extract from highly informative summary statistics as a function of the number of simulations used to train the network, for a wide range of architectures and hyperparameters. Looking beyond two-point statistics, we find a similar scaling law for the training of neural posterior inference using wavelet scattering transform coefficients. To verify our method, we created the largest publicly released suite of cosmological simulations, the BIG SOBOL SEQUENCE (BSQ), consisting of 32 768 Λ cold dark matter N-body simulations uniformly covering the Λ cold dark matter parameter space. Our method enables efficient planning of simulation campaigns for machine learning applications in cosmology, while the BSQ dataset provides an unprecedented resource for studying the convergence behavior of NNs in cosmological parameter inference. Our results suggest that new large simulation suites or new training approaches will be necessary to infer information-optimal parameters from nonlinear simulations.Key words: methods: statistical / cosmological parameters / dark matter / large-scale structure of Universe"

  abstract: We introduce a new model for conditional and continuous data morphing called TRansport Adversarial Network for Smooth InTerpolation (TRANSIT). We apply it to create a background data template for weakly-supervised searches at the LHC. The method smoothly transforms sideband events to match signal region mass distributions. We demonstrate the performance of TRANSIT using the LHC Olympics R&D dataset. The model captures non-linear mass correlations of features and produces a template that offers a competitive anomaly sensitivity compared to state-of-the-art transport-based template generators. Moreover, the computational training time required for TRANSIT is an order of magnitude lower than that of competing deep learning methods. This makes it ideal for analyses that iterate over many signal regions and signal models. Unlike generative models, which must learn a full probability density distribution, i.e., the correlations between all the variables, the proposed transport model only has to learn a smooth conditional shift of the distribution. This allows for a simpler, more efficient residual architecture, enabling mass uncorrelated features to pass the network unchanged while the mass correlated features are adjusted accordingly. Furthermore, we show that the latent space of the model provides a set of mass decorrelated features useful for anomaly detection without background sculpting.

  abstract: Binary population synthesis simulations allow detailed modelling of gravitational-wave sources from a variety of formation channels. These population models can be compared to the observed catalogue of merging binaries to infer the uncertain astrophysical input parameters describing binary formation and evolution, as well as the relative rates between various formation pathways. However, it is computationally infeasible to run population synthesis simulations for all variations of uncertain input physics. We demonstrate the use of normalizing flows to emulate population synthesis results and interpolate between astrophysical input parameters. Using current gravitational-wave observations of binary black holes, we use our trained normalizing flows to infer branching ratios between multiple formation channels, and simultaneously infer common-envelope efficiency and natal spins across a continuous parameter range. Given our set of formation channel models, we infer the natal spin to be 0.04−0.01+0.04, and the common-envelope efficiency to be >3.7 at 90% credibility, with the majority of underlying mergers coming from the common-envelope channel. Our framework allows us to measure population synthesis inputs where we do not have simulations, and better constrain the astrophysics underlying current gravitational-wave populations.

MLP-Mixers excel in processing sequences of jet constituents, achieving state-of-the-art performance on datasets mimicking Large Hadron Collider conditions. By using advanced optimization techniques such as High-Granularity Quantization and Distributed Arithmetic, we achieve unprecedented efficiency. These models match or surpass the accuracy of previous architectures, reduce hardware resource usage by up to 97%, double the throughput, and half the latency. Additionally, non-permutation-invariant architectures enable smart feature prioritization and efficient FPGA deployment, setting a new benchmark for machine learning in real-time data processing at particle colliders.

  abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is driving a revolution in the way scientists design, develop, and deploy data-intensive software. However, the adoption of ML presents new challenges for the computing infrastructure, particularly in terms of provisioning and orchestrating access to hardware accelerators for development, testing, and production. The INFN-funded project AI_INFN (“Artificial Intelligence at INFN”) aims at fostering the adoption of ML techniques within INFN use cases by providing support on multiple aspects, including the provision of AI-tailored computing resources. It leverages cloud-native solutions in the context of INFN Cloud, to share hardware accelerators as effectively as possible, ensuring the diversity of the Institute’s research activities is not compromised. In this contribution, we provide an update on the commissioning of a Kubernetes platform designed to ease the development of GPU-powered data analysis workflows and their scalability on heterogeneous, distributed computing resources, possibly federated as Virtual Kubelets with the interLink provider.

  abstract: "We demonstrate transfer learning capabilities in a machine-learned algorithm trained for particle-flow reconstruction in high energy particle colliders. This paper presents a cross-detector fine-tuning study, where we initially pretrain the model on a large full simulation dataset from one detector design, and subsequently fine-tune the model on a sample with a different collider and detector design. Specifically, we use the Compact Linear Collider detector (CLICdet) model for the initial training set and demonstrate successful knowledge transfer to the CLIC-like detector (CLD) proposed for the Future Circular Collider in electron-positron mode. We show that with an order of magnitude less samples from the second dataset, we can achieve the same performance as a costly training from scratch, across particle-level and event-level performance metrics, including jet and missing transverse momentum resolution. Furthermore, we find that the fine-tuned model achieves comparable performance to the traditional rule-based particle-flow approach on event-level metrics after training on 100,000 CLD events, whereas a model trained from scratch requires at least 1\_million CLD events to achieve similar reconstruction performance. To our knowledge, this represents the first full-simulation cross-detector transfer learning study for particle-flow reconstruction. These findings offer valuable insights towards building large foundation models that can be fine-tuned across different detector designs and geometries, helping to accelerate the development cycle for new detectors and opening the door to rapid detector design and optimization using machine learning."

  abstract: Quantum computer emulators model the behavior and error rates of specific quantum processors. Without accurate noise models in these emulators, it is challenging for users to optimize and debug executable quantum programs prior to running them on the quantum device, as device-specific noise is not properly accounted for. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a general protocol to approximate device-specific emulators without requiring pulse-level control. By applying machine learning to data obtained from gate set tomography, we construct a device-specific emulator by predicting the noise model input parameters that best match the target device. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol's emulator in estimating the unitary coupled cluster energy of the H$_2$ molecule and compare the results with those from actual quantum hardware. Remarkably, our noise model captures device noise with high accuracy, achieving a mean absolute difference of just 0.3% in expectation value relative to the state-vector simulation.

  abstract: Classical diffusion models have achieved remarkable results in terms of sample quality and variability. The quantum counterpart of these models is still to be explored thoroughly and offers a promising research direction in the field of quantum generative models. In this work, we introduce two versions of a quantum diffusion model, using parameterized quantum circuits to sample from quantum state distributions, while performing training via classical simulations. The first model is a quantum-hardware-oriented design, based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models, for which we demonstrate an implementation on real quantum hardware. The second model is a hybrid approach, based on denoising diffusion implicit models, that uses a classical neural network to enhance the expressive power. We show that the second version produces samples of higher quality and variability, but requires additional classical-quantum encoding and decoding overhead, underscoring a trade-off between expressive power and hardware efficiency. We demonstrate our method on MNIST images encoded as quantum states, as sample quality is easier to visualize and objective metrics are more widely available. While our results do not surpass classical diffusion models in the generation of classical samples, this study suggests the viability of using quantum diffusion models for learning quantum state distributions.

  abstract: Magnetic hysteresis and eddy current decay continue to challenge beam quality and operational consistency in multi-cycling machines like the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN. Building on our previous work, this paper presents improvements in the data-driven approach for magnetic field modelling to enhance the reproducibility of SPS dipole and quadrupole fields and thus maintain stable beam parameters across all operational cycles. The method is based on feed-forward correction using magnetic field forecasting with machine learning. It now includes additional operational experience and demonstrates that the field error compensation can reliably be used in operation. This contribution proves that hysteresis compensation can be achieved without a feedback system based on expensive installations with online field measurements in reference magnets. The performance improvements achieved by eliminating the need for manual adjustments and reducing time- and energy-consuming accelerator pre-cycles are presented. The paper also sets the stage for future application in higher-order magnets, like sextupoles and octupoles, as well as on other CERN synchrotrons.

  abstract: The slow extracted beams at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) are transported over several 100 m long transfer lines to three targets in the CERN North Area Experimental Hall. The experiments need intensity fluctuations to be entirely eliminated over the roughly 5 s particle spill, requiring full debunching of the extracted beams. In this environment, secondary emission monitors (SEMs) have to replace the conventional beam position monitoring systems that rely on RF structure, with the intensity difference on split secondary emission foils used to indicate the beam position. Traditional trajectory correction algorithms however fail when the beam ends up on a single foil. This paper summarises successful first tests with reinforcement learning (RL) to learn to correct the trajectory based on foil intensity measurements. The RL agents were trained in simulation and then successfully transferred to the real accelerator environment. Results of the application of the trained RL agents for the alignment of moveable split foils in front of the targets will also be presented.

  abstract: At CERN’s Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR), high beam intensities are achieved through phase space painting with up to eight multi-turn injections from the linear accelerator Linac3. After each injection, the beam is cooled and stacked in longitudinal phase space using an electron cooler. During beam operation, key parameters such as RF cavity phases in the linac, the LEIR electron cooler gun voltage, and various magnetic field strengths along the transfer line must be frequently adjusted to compensate for the injection performance degradation occurring over time. The primary cause is the aging of the stripper foil, a thin carbon plate which strips off electrons from the passing ions, altering the energy of the beam injected from the linac. Time of flight measurements in the linac and Schottky signals in the ring provide the necessary diagnostics for correcting the performance degradation and can be encoded to provide a state for an optimizer. In this paper, we compare several data-driven methods, such as Bayesian Optimization and Reinforcement Learning for designing an autonomous controller to optimize and maintain injection performance during both beam commissioning and physics runs.

  abstract: The CERN accelerator complex relies critically on fast injection and extraction processes to transfer particle beams between accelerators via fast pulsed magnets, or kickers. Ensuring high availability is paramount, as the reliability of these systems directly impacts the large number of experiments conducted at CERN. In this paper, we propose to explore Continual Learning (CL) methods, specifically using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to develop an anomaly detection system for the fast kicker magnets. By continuously learning from evolving data while retaining prior knowledge, these models will be capable of detecting anomalies without the need for repeated retraining. This approach is particularly relevant for ensuring the reliability and stability of kicker magnets, where early anomaly detection is critical for preventing performance degradation.

  abstract: Particle accelerators like CLEAR (CERN Linear Accearator for research) are essential tools in advancing various scientific fields. Automating their operation to ensure stability and reproducibility is crucial for future large-scale projects. This paper explores the first steps toward autonomous control of the CLEAR beamline, focusing initially on beam steering and advancing to complex tasks like quadrupole alignment, vital for operational stability. Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents that adapt in real-time via beam screens measurements were trained and tested. The approach is optimized for sampling efficiency, addressing the high cost and invasiveness of data collection in accelerator environments. The method enables single-shot optimization for real operations, reducing the need for manual intervention. Results show that a few hours of training suffice for effective single-step corrections in the latter part of the CLEAR beamline, inspiring further development by the CLEAR research team.

  abstract: "We present R-ANODE, a new method for data-driven, model-agnostic resonant anomaly detection that raises the bar for both performance and interpretability. The key to R-ANODE is to enhance the inductive bias of the anomaly detection task by fitting a normalizing flow directly to the small and unknown signal component, while holding fixed a background model (also a normalizing flow) learned from sidebands. In\_doing so, R-ANODE is able to outperform all classifier-based, weakly supervised approaches as well as the previous ANODE method, which fit a density estimator to all of the data in the signal region instead of just the signal. We show that the method works equally well whether the unknown signal fraction is learned or fixed and is even robust to signal fraction misspecification. Finally, with the learned signal model, we can sample and gain qualitative insights into the underlying anomaly, which greatly enhances the interpretability of resonant anomaly detection and offers the possibility of simultaneously discovering and characterizing the new physics that could be hiding in the data."

  abstract: This study presents the exclusive analysis of the \(pp\rightarrow ppK^{+}K^{-}\) reaction with data taken with the HADES detector in February 2022 at a center-of-mass energy of 3.47 GeV. A neural network-based particle identification was developed that compensates for simulation-experiment discrepancies through domain adversarial technique. The background was suppressed by means of kinematic refit with 4 overconstraints corresponding to the conservation of 4-momentum, which allowed us to obtain a high-purity sample of data with \(S/B\approx 15\). Clear signals from \(\phi (1020) \to K^{+}K^{-}\) and \({\mit \Lambda }(1520) \to pK^{-}\) decays were observed with their parameters consistent with those published by the PDG. Moreover, the importance of \(K^{+}K^{-}\) non-resonant final-state interactions was confirmed. This paper discusses the details of our event selection, efficiency corrections, and presents a number of intermediate results.

The superconducting dipole magnets have been produced and the magnet field errors up to 7th order have been measured for all magnets. The superconducting quadrupole magnets are under production, the field error data for a part of the magnets is available. As a part of the magnet quality assessment, the particle tracking simulations are used to study the beam losses during the 1 sec beam accumulation at the injection energy. The tune settings for the slow extraction operation are considered. Direct space-charge effects and the Landau damping octupole magnets, which dominate the incoherent tune distribution, are included. In order to reduce the computational load and to increase the parameter resolution, a machine learning based optimizer is used in the accelerator and beam parameter studies.

  abstract: To construct a closed orbit model for an accelerator ring with intrinsic uncertainty quantification from orbit measurements, a physics-informed Gaussian Process model is proposed based on a stochastic ensemble of MAD-X lattices. Key advantages compared to LOCO (Linear Optics from Closed Orbits) include (1.) uncertainty-enabled orbit prediction in between BPMs (beam position monitors), (2.) fitting of a parameter distribution (dipole-like field errors) which inherently models uncertainty, (3.) incorporation of measurement uncertainty from BPM noise, and (4.) an active learning approach which can be more sample efficient than measuring an orbit response matrix. A case study is presented for the GSI heavy ion synchrotron SIS18 with various simulated applications, in particular constructing an effective machine model with minimal orbit uncertainty around the ring, and orbit correction to achieve minimal deviation at a specific location such as, e.g., the septum to control beam loss during slow extraction. This physics-inspired Gaussian Process regression approach shows potential to be applied to optics correction and further applications beyond closed orbit correction.

  abstract: Particle accelerators are critical tools in multiple domains of fundamental and applied science—from high-energy physics to materials research and medical imaging. Yet achieving optimal beam performance and operational stability remains a complex challenge, driven by myriad interdependent parameters and nonlinear dynamics. In this work, we explore how artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods can be leveraged to push the frontiers of accelerator performance and control. We present (i) a survey of state-of-the-art AI/ML techniques tailored for accelerator diagnostics, beam tuning, and anomaly detection; (ii) a case study applying supervised and reinforcement learning strategies to beam optimization in a hypothetical accelerator environment; and (iii) an analysis of the limitations, risks, and integration challenges in real accelerator systems. Our results highlight that AI approaches can significantly reduce tuning time, improve stability under varying operational conditions, and enhance predictive maintenance capabilities. We further discuss how future developments—such as online learning, hybrid physics-ML models, and shared benchmark datasets—could accelerate adoption of AI in accelerator science. This paper aims to stimulate deeper collaborations between the accelerator and AI communities, and to encourage deployment of intelligent control systems in next-generation accelerator facilities.

  abstract: The LHC was conceived as the ultimate discovery machine, designed mainly to find the Higgs boson and extensively search for SUSY and its alternatives at the electroweak (EW) energy scale. After a decade of operation, thanks to improved detector performance and advanced algorithms, the LHC experiments entered a precision era, surpassing LEP and Tevatron in many areas. Innovations such as deep learning and new data-taking methods have further extended their reach, beyond assumed limitations such as the trigger bandwidth. The luminosity upgrade of LHC, HL-LHC, promises even greater precision with upgraded detectors. The LHC experiments will remain leading in high-energy physics for the foreseeable future, leaving a lasting impact on various fronts.</jats:p>

  abstract: "The Fair Universe project organised the HiggsML Uncertainty Challenge. This groundbreaking competition in high-energy physics (HEP) and machine learning was the first to strongly emphasise uncertainties, focusing on mastering both the uncertainties in the input training data and providing credible confidence intervals in the results. The challenge revolved around measuring the\_$(H \\rightarrow \\tau^+ \\tau^-)$\_cross-section, similar to the HiggsML challenge held on Kaggle in 2014, using a dataset representing the 4-momentum signal state. Participants were tasked with developing advanced analysis techniques to measure the signal strength and generate confidence intervals that included both statistical and systematic uncertainties. The accuracy of these intervals was automatically evaluated using pseudo-experiments to assess correct coverage. The dataset is now published in Zenodo, and the winning submissions are fully documented."

  abstract: The HiggsML Uncertainty Challenge is a machine learning competition aimed at improving uncertainty-aware AI techniques in high-energy physics. Part of the FAIR Universe initiative, focuses on estimating the Higgs boson signal strength while accounting for systematic uncertainties affecting collider experiments. Unlike traditional classification tasks, participants must construct confidence intervals that properly cover systematic distortions. The HiggsML Uncertainty Challenge establishes a benchmark for uncertainty-aware AI, with applications in high-energy physics and beyond. The competition is hosted on Codabench, an open AI benchmarking platform, and uses highperformance computing resources at NERSC Perlmutter for scalable and reproducible model evaluation. The dataset and evaluation framework will remain publicly available for continued research.

  abstract: The reconstruction of particle trajectories is a key challenge of particle physics experiments, as it directly impacts particle identification and physics performances. Additionally, it is one of the primary consumers of CPU resources in many high-energy physics experiments. As the luminosity of particle colliders increases, this reconstruction will become more complex and resource-intensive. Therefore, new algorithms are needed to address these challenges efficiently.During track reconstruction, more tracks are reconstructed than the actual truth particles due to fake tracks and redundant duplicates. This inefficiency is costly since each track requires individual reconstruction.We propose using a ranking-based machine learning algorithm to select track seeds before the actual track reconstruction occurs. By employing a DBSCAN clustering algorithm to group similar particle seeds and a Neural Network (NN) with a novel Margin Ranking Loss Function to score them, we can significantly reduce the number of tracks that need to be reconstructed, thereby speeding up the tracking process. This method has been implemented within the A Common Tracking Software framework and tested on the Open Data Detector, resulting in a twofold speedup with an efficiency reduction of only 0.2 percentage points.

  abstract: The upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) represents the next generation of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), offering a significantly enhanced sensitivity, up to five to ten times greater than existing instruments. Its first prototype, the Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1), is currently operational at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in La Palma, Spain. Deep learning techniques have shown promising results in reconstructing key physical properties of incident particles, such as energy, arrival direction, and particle classification, when applied to simulated data. While traditional techniques rely on simple parameterization of the shower image shape, deep learning can leverage the full temporal and charge information of the images, extracting additional information that is particularly valuable at the lowest energies (~20 GeV) accessible by LST-1. These insights are crucial for studying distant extragalactic sources, such as Active Galactic Nuclei, which can serve as probes for fundamental physics and cosmology. In this context, GammaLearn, a deep learning framework for IACTs data analysis, has demonstrated strong potential in this energy range (Vuillaume et al., 2021, ICRC).Here, we apply GammaLearn to observational data from LST-1 to assess its performance on real data.

  abstract: To maximize the amount of information extracted from cosmological datasets, simulations that accurately represent these observations are necessary. However, traditional simulations that evolve particles under gravity by estimating particle-particle interactions (<math display="inline"><mi>N</mi></math>-body simulations) are computationally expensive and prohibitive to scale to the large volumes and resolutions necessary for the upcoming datasets. Moreover, modeling the distribution of galaxies typically involves identifying virialized dark matter halos, which is also a time- and memory-consuming process for large <math display="inline"><mi>N</mi></math>-body simulations, further exacerbating the computational cost. In this study, we introduce CHARM, a novel method for creating mock halo catalogs by matching the spatial, mass, and velocity statistics of halos directly from the large-scale distribution of the dark matter density field. We develop multistage neural spline flow-based networks to learn this mapping at redshift <math display="inline"><mi>z</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.5</mn></math> directly with computationally cheaper low-resolution particle mesh simulations instead of relying on the high-resolution <math display="inline"><mi>N</mi></math>-body simulations. We show that the mock halo catalogs and painted galaxy catalogs have the same statistical properties as obtained from <math display="inline"><mi>N</mi></math>-body simulations in both real space and redshift space. Finally, we use these mock catalogs for cosmological inference using redshift-space galaxy power spectrum, bispectrum, and wavelet-based statistics using simulation-based inference, performing the first inference with accelerated forward model simulations and finding unbiased cosmological constraints with well-calibrated posteriors.
