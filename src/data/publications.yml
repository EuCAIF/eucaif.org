  abstract: Experimental particle physics seeks to understand the universe by probing its fundamental particles and forces and exploring how they govern the large-scale processes that shape cosmic evolution. This whitepaper presents a vision for how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can accelerate discovery in this field. We outline grand challenges that must be addressed to enable transformative breakthroughs and describe how current and planned experimental facilities can implement this vision to advance our understanding of the vast and complex physical world from the smallest to the largest scales. We show how facilities currently under construction, such as the HL-LHC, DUNE and soon EIC, can both benefit from and serve as proving grounds for this vision, while also enabling a longer-term goal for how future experiments -- like FCC-ee at CERN, IceCube-Gen2, a Muon Collider in the U.S., and smaller to mid-scale projects -- can be fully AI-native. We describe how a truly national-scale collaboration, jointly managed across large funding partners, and involving both DOE laboratories and universities, can make this happen.

  abstract: This paper presents the first demonstration of a viable, ultra-fast, radiation-hard machine learning (ML) application on FPGAs, which could be used in future high-energy physics experiments. We present a three-fold contribution, with the PicoCal calorimeter, planned for the LHCb Upgrade II experiment, used as a test case. First, we develop a lightweight autoencoder to compress a 32-sample timing readout, representative of that of the PicoCal, into a two-dimensional latent space. Second, we introduce a systematic, hardware-aware quantization strategy and show that the model can be reduced to 10-bit weights with minimal performance loss. Third, as a barrier to the adoption of on-detector ML is the lack of support for radiation-hard FPGAs in the High-Energy Physics community's standard ML synthesis tool, hls4ml, we develop a new backend for this library. This new back-end enables the automatic translation of ML models into High-Level Synthesis (HLS) projects for the Microchip PolarFire family of FPGAs, one of the few commercially available and radiation hard FPGAs. We present the synthesis of the autoencoder on a target PolarFire FPGA, which indicates that a latency of 25 ns can be achieved. We show that the resources utilized are low enough that the model can be placed within the inherently protected logic of the FPGA. Our extension to hls4ml is a significant contribution, paving the way for broader adoption of ML on FPGAs in high-radiation environments.

  abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has established that scaling compute, through joint increases in model capacity and dataset size, is the primary driver of performance in modern machine learning. While machine learning has long been an integral component of High Energy Physics (HEP) data analysis workflows, the compute used to train state-of-the-art HEP models remains orders of magnitude below that of industry foundation models. With scaling laws only beginning to be studied in the field, we investigate neural scaling laws for boosted jet classification using the public JetClass dataset. We derive compute optimal scaling laws and identify an effective performance limit that can be consistently approached through increased compute. We study how data repetition, common in HEP where simulation is expensive, modifies the scaling yielding a quantifiable effective dataset size gain. We then study how the scaling coefficients and asymptotic performance limits vary with the choice of input features and particle multiplicity, demonstrating that increased compute reliably drives performance toward an asymptotic limit, and that more expressive, lower-level features can raise the performance limit and improve results at fixed dataset size.

  abstract: Next-generation GW observatories such as the ET and CE will detect BNS and NSBH inspirals with high SNRs and long in-band durations, making systematic early-warning alerts both feasible and scientifically valuable. Such triggers are essential for coordinating rapid electromagnetic follow-up. In this work, we introduce GW-FALCON, a novel feature-driven DL framework for early-time detection between GW signal+noise and noise-only data in next-generation detectors. Instead of feeding raw time series to CNN or more complex neural network architectures, we first extract a large set of statistical, temporal, and spectral quantities from short observational time windows using the TSFEL library. The resulting fixed-length feature vectors are then used as input to feed-forward ANNs suitable for low-latency operation. We demonstrate the method using simulated BNS and NSBH inspiral waveforms injected into colored Gaussian noise generated from the ET and CE design PSDs. We train separate ANNs on feature sets extracted from partial-inspiral windows characterized by different maximum instantaneous frequencies, enabling early-warning triggers from tens to hundreds of seconds before merger. Across all detector configurations and datasets, the resulting classifiers achieve high accuracy and detection efficiency, with ET-like networks typically reaching test accuracies of order 90% and CE-like ones exceeding 97% at low false-alarm probability. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first comprehensive feature-based DL detection framework for Next-generation GW observatories, connecting feature extraction from strain time series data to robust signal-noise classification within a setup that can be extended to real data and to more advanced neural network architectures.

  abstract: MadSpace is a new modular phase-space and event-generation library written in C++ with native GPU support via CUDA and HIP. It provides a unified compute-graph-based framework for phase-space construction, adaptive and neural importance sampling, and event unweighting. It includes a wide range of mappings, from the standard MadGraph multi-channel phase space to optimized normalizing flows with analytic inverse transformations. All components operate on batches of events and support end-to-end on-device workflows. A high-level Python interface enables seamless integration with machine-learning libraries such as PyTorch.

  abstract: Principled Bayesian inference of galaxy properties has not previously been performed for wide-area weak lensing surveys with millions of sources. We address this gap by applying the pop-cosmos generative model to perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting for 4 million KiDS-1000 galaxies. Calibrated on deep COSMOS2020 photometric data, pop-cosmos specifies a physically-motivated prior over the galaxy population up to $z \simeq 6$ in stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameter space. Using the Speculator SPS emulator with GPU-accelerated MCMC sampling, we perform full posterior inference at 6.5 GPU seconds per galaxy, obtaining joint constraints on galaxy redshifts and physical properties. We validate photometric redshifts against $\sim\!185,\!000$ KiDS galaxies cross-matched to DESI DR1 spectroscopic samples, achieving low bias ($3\times10^{-3}$), scatter ($σ_{\mathrm{MAD}}=0.04$), and outlier fraction (3.7%) for the Bright Galaxy Survey, with comparable performance (bias $3\times10^{-2}$, $σ_{\mathrm{MAD}}=0.05$, 1.3% outliers) for luminous red galaxies (LRGs). Within the LRG sample, we identify massive, dusty, star-forming contaminants at $z \simeq 0.4$ satisfying standard colour selections for quenched populations. We infer trends in stellar mass, star formation, metallicity, and dust across five tomographic redshift bins consistent with established scaling relations. Using specific star formation rate constraints, we identify $\sim$10% of KiDS-1000 galaxies as quenched, versus 37% implied by conservative colour cuts. This enables the construction of weak lensing samples defined by physical properties while mitigating intrinsic alignment systematics and preserving statistical power. Our analysis validates pop-cosmos out-of-sample, establishing it as a scaleable approach for galaxy evolution and cosmological analyses in photometric surveys.

  abstract: "The accuracy of the cosmological constraints from Stage~IV galaxy surveys will be limited by how well the galaxy redshift distributions can be inferred. We have addressed this challenging problem for the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) cosmic shear sample by developing a forward-modeling framework with two main ingredients: (1) the \\texttt{pop-cosmos} generative model for the evolving galaxy population, calibrated on \\textit{Spitzer} IRAC $\\textit{Ch.\\,1}<26$ galaxies from COSMOS2020; and (2) a data model for noise and selection, machine-learned from the SURFS-based KiDS-Legacy-Like Simulations (SKiLLS). Applying KiDS tomographic binning to our synthetic photometric data, we infer redshift distributions in each of five bins directly from the population and data models, bypassing the need for spectroscopic reweighting. Keeping the data model fixed, we compare results using two different galaxy population models: \\texttt{pop-cosmos}; and \\texttt{shark}, the semi-analytic galaxy formation model used in SKiLLS. In the first ($0.1<z<0.3$) and last ($0.9<z<1.2$) tomographic bins we find systematic differences in the mean redshifts of $Δz\\sim0.05$-$0.1$, comparable to the reported uncertainties from spectroscopic reweighting methods. This work paves the way for accurate redshift distribution calibration for Stage~IV surveys directly through forward modeling, thus providing an independent cross-check on spectroscopic-based calibrations which avoids their selection biases and incompleteness. We will use the \\texttt{pop-cosmos} redshift distributions in an upcoming full KiDS cosmology reanalysis."

  abstract: Symmetries play a central role in physics, organizing dynamics, constraining interactions, and determining the effective number of physical degrees of freedom. In parallel, modern artificial intelligence methods have demonstrated a remarkable ability to extract low-dimensional structure from high-dimensional data through representation learning. This review examines the interplay between these two perspectives, focusing on the extent to which symmetry-induced constraints can be identified, encoded, or diagnosed using machine learning techniques. Rather than emphasizing architectures that enforce known symmetries by construction, we concentrate on data-driven approaches and latent representation learning, with particular attention to variational autoencoders. We discuss how symmetries and conservation laws reduce the intrinsic dimensionality of physical datasets, and how this reduction may manifest itself through self-organization of latent spaces in generative models trained to balance reconstruction and compression. We review recent results, including case studies from simple geometric systems and particle physics processes, and analyze the theoretical and practical limitations of inferring symmetry structure without explicit inductive bias.

  abstract: A search is performed for a heavy scalar resonance X decaying to a Higgs boson (H) and a Higgs-like scalar boson (Y) in the two bottom quark (H $\to$$\mathrm{b\bar{b}}$) and four quark (Y $\to$ VV $\to$ 4q) final state, where V denotes a W or Z boson. Masses of the X between 900 and 4000 GeV and the Y between 60 and 2800 GeV are considered. The search is performed in data collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC from proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV center-of-mass energy, with a data set corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. It targets the Lorentz-boosted regime, in which the products of the H $\to$$\mathrm{b\bar{b}}$ decay can be reconstructed as a single large-area jet, and those from the Y $\to$ VV $\to$ 4q decay as either one Y $\to$ 4q or two V to $\mathrm{q\bar{q}}$ jets. Jet identification and mass reconstruction exploit machine-learning tools, including a novel attention-based "particle transformer" for Y $\to$ 4q identification. No significant excess is observed in the data above the standard model background expectation. Upper limits on the product of production cross section and branching fraction as low as 0.2 fb are derived at 95% confidence level for various mass hypotheses. This is the first search at the LHC for scalar resonances in the all-hadronic $\mathrm{b\bar{b}}$VV decay channel.

  abstract: A model-independent search for low-mass resonances decaying into pairs of oppositely charged muons is presented. The analysis uses proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$, recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider between 2015 and 2018. The search targets hypothetical dimuon resonances in the invariant mass range from 35 GeV to 75 GeV. The modelling of this mass region is particularly challenging for conventional analytic background parameterisations. To address this, a Gaussian process regression technique is used to model the background. The dimuon mass spectrum is analysed for potential signals, and no statistically significant excess is observed. Upper limits at the 95% confidence level are set on the fiducial production cross-section of new resonances decaying promptly into muons, ranging from 20 fb to 110 fb, depending on the resonance mass. These results are further interpreted in the context of dark-photon and dark-matter-mediator models, leading to new constraints on their parameter spaces.

  abstract: We demonstrate that gauge equivariant diffusion models can accurately model the physics of non-Abelian lattice gauge theory using the Metropolis-adjusted annealed Langevin algorithm (MAALA), as exemplified by computations in two-dimensional U(2) and SU(2) gauge theories. Our network architecture is based on lattice gauge equivariant convolutional neural networks (L-CNNs), which respect local and global symmetries on the lattice. Models are trained on a single ensemble generated using a traditional Monte Carlo method. By studying Wilson loops of various size as well as the topological susceptibility, we find that the diffusion approach generalizes remarkably well to larger inverse couplings and lattice sizes with negligible loss of accuracy while retaining moderately high acceptance rates.

  abstract: Cross-correlations between 21cm observations and galaxy surveys provide a powerful probe of reionization by reducing foreground sensitivity while linking ionization morphology to galaxies. We quantify the constraining power of 21cm-Galaxy cross-power spectra for inferring neutral hydrogen fraction $x_\mathrm{HI}(z)$ and mean overdensity $\langle 1+δ_\mathrm{HI} \rangle(z)$, exploring dependence on field of view, redshift precision $σ_z$, and minimum halo mass $M_\mathrm{h,min}$. We employ our simulation-based inference framework EoRFlow for likelihood-free parameter estimation. Mock observations include thermal noise for 100h SKA-Low with foreground avoidance and realistic galaxy survey effects. For a fiducial survey ($\mathrm{FOV}=100\,\mathrm{deg}^2$, $σ_z=0.001$, $M_\mathrm{h,min}=10^{11}\mathrm{M}_\odot$), cross-power spectra yield unbiased constraints with posterior volumes (PV) of $\sim$10% relative to priors. Cross-power measurements reduce PV by 20-30% versus 21cm auto-power alone. With foreground avoidance, spectroscopic redshift precision is essential; photometric redshifts render cross-correlations uninformative. Notably, cross-power spectra constrain ionizing source properties, the escape fraction $f_\mathrm{esc}$ and star formation efficiency $f_*$, which remain degenerate in auto-power (PV $>$60%). Tight constraints require either deep surveys detecting faint galaxies ($M_\mathrm{h,min} \sim 10^{10}\mathrm{M}_\odot$) with moderate foregrounds, or conservative mass limits with optimistic foreground removal (PV $<$15%). 21cm-Galaxy cross-correlations enhance morphology constraints beyond auto-power while enabling previously inaccessible source property constraints. Realizing full potential requires precise redshifts and either faint galaxy detection limits or improved 21cm foreground cleaning.

  abstract: Gauge-mediated supersymmetry-breaking models provide a strong motivation to search for a supersymmetric partner of the tau lepton (stau) with a macroscopic lifetime. Long-lived stau decays produce tau leptons that are displaced from the primary proton-proton interaction vertex, leading to an unconventional signature. This paper presents a search for the direct production of long-lived staus decaying within the CMS tracker volume in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, performed for the first time with an identification algorithm based on a graph neural network dedicated to displaced tau leptons. The data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$, was recorded with the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC between 2016 and 2018. This search excludes, at 95% confidence level, stau masses, $m_\tildeτ$, in the 126$-$260 (906$-$425) GeV range for a proper decay length of 50 mm in the maximally mixed (mass-degenerate) scenario, while for $m_\tildeτ $ = 200 GeV, stau proper decay lengths are excluded in the range 21$-$94 (6$-$333) mm. These results improve the exclusion limits compared to previous searches, and extend the parameter space explored in the context of supersymmetry.

  abstract: "Two machine learning techniques for jet measurements at the LHCb experiment are presented: a regression-based method for jet-energy calibration and a deep neural network algorithm for jet flavour tagging, distinguishing between $b$-quark, $c$-quark, and light parton jets. These techniques are applied to a search for inclusive $H \\to \\bbbar$ and $H \\to c\\barcc$ decays using a LHCb dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.6\\invfb. The observed (expected) 95% confidence level upper limits correspond to 6.6 (11.1) times the SM cross-section for the $H \\to b\\bar b$ process, and 1003 (1834) times the SM cross-section for the $H \\to c\\bar c$ process."

  abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will produce unprecedented volumes of heterogeneous astronomical data (images, catalogs, and alerts) that challenge traditional analysis pipelines. The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) aims to derive robust constraints on dark energy and dark matter from these data, requiring methods that are statistically powerful, scalable, and operationally reliable. Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) are already embedded across DESC science workflows, from photometric redshifts and transient classification to weak lensing inference and cosmological simulations. Yet their utility for precision cosmology hinges on trustworthy uncertainty quantification, robustness to covariate shift and model misspecification, and reproducible integration within scientific pipelines. This white paper surveys the current landscape of AI/ML across DESC's primary cosmological probes and cross-cutting analyses, revealing that the same core methodologies and fundamental challenges recur across disparate science cases. Since progress on these cross-cutting challenges would benefit multiple probes simultaneously, we identify key methodological research priorities, including Bayesian inference at scale, physics-informed methods, validation frameworks, and active learning for discovery. With an eye on emerging techniques, we also explore the potential of the latest foundation model methodologies and LLM-driven agentic AI systems to reshape DESC workflows, provided their deployment is coupled with rigorous evaluation and governance. Finally, we discuss critical software, computing, data infrastructure, and human capital requirements for the successful deployment of these new methodologies, and consider associated risks and opportunities for broader coordination with external actors.

  abstract: We demonstrate the capabilities of probabilistic diffusion models to reduce dramatically the computational cost of expensive hydrodynamical simulations to study the relationship between observable baryonic cosmological probes and dark matter at field level and well into the non-linear regime. We introduce a novel technique, Cosmo-FOLD (Cosmological Fields via Overlap Latent Diffusion) to rapidly generate accurate and arbitrarily large cosmological and astrophysical 3-dimensional fields, conditioned on a given input field. We are able to generate TNG300-2 dark matter density and gas temperature fields from a model trained only on ~1% of the volume (a process we refer to as `upscaling'), reproducing both large scale coherent dark matter filaments and power spectra to within 10% for wavenumbers k <= 5 h Mpc^-1. These results are obtained within a small fraction of the original simulation cost and produced on a single GPU. Beyond one and two points statistics, the bispectrum is also faithfully reproduced through the inclusion of positional encodings. Finally, we demonstrate Cosmo-FOLD's generalisation capabilities by upscaling a CAMELS volume of 25 (Mpc h^-1)^3 to a full TNG300-2 volume of 205 (Mpc h^-1)^3$ with no fine-tuning. Cosmo-FOLD opens the door to full field-level simulation-based inference on cosmological scale.

  abstract: Scaling laws describing the dependence of neural network performance on the amount of training data, the spent compute, and the network size have emerged across a huge variety of machine learning task and datasets. In this work, we systematically investigate these scaling laws in the context of amplitude surrogates for particle physics. We show that the scaling coefficients are connected to the number of external particles of the process. Our results demonstrate that scaling laws are a useful tool to achieve desired precision targets.

  abstract: Accurate and efficient detector simulation is essential for modern collider experiments. To reduce the high computational cost, various fast machine learning surrogate models have been proposed. Traditional surrogate models for calorimeter shower modeling train separate networks for each particle species, limiting scalability and reuse. We introduce AllShowers, a unified generative model that simulates calorimeter showers across multiple particle types using a single generative model. AllShowers is a continuous normalizing flow model with a Transformer architecture, enabling it to generate complex spatial and energy correlations in variable-length point cloud representations of showers. Trained on a diverse dataset of simulated showers in the highly granular ILD detector, the model demonstrates the ability to generate realistic showers for electrons, photons, and charged and neutral hadrons across a wide range of incident energies and angles without retraining. In addition to unifying shower generation for multiple particle types, AllShowers surpasses the fidelity of previous single-particle-type models for hadronic showers. Key innovations include the use of a layer embedding, allowing the model to learn all relevant calorimeter layer properties; a custom attention masking scheme to reduce computational demands and introduce a helpful inductive bias; and a shower- and layer-wise optimal transport mapping to improve training convergence and sample quality. AllShowers marks a significant step towards a universal model for calorimeter shower simulations in collider experiments.

  abstract: "A key challenge in designing normalizing flows is finding expressive scalar bijections that remain invertible with tractable Jacobians. Existing approaches face trade-offs: affine transformations are smooth and analytically invertible but lack expressivity; monotonic splines offer local control but are only piecewise smooth and act on bounded domains; residual flows achieve smoothness but need numerical inversion. We introduce three families of analytic bijections -- cubic rational, sinh, and cubic polynomial -- that are globally smooth ($C^\\infty$), defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, and analytically invertible in closed form, combining the favorable properties of all prior approaches. These bijections serve as drop-in replacements in coupling flows, matching or exceeding spline performance. Beyond coupling layers, we develop radial flows: a novel architecture using direct parametrization that transforms the radial coordinate while preserving angular direction. Radial flows exhibit exceptional training stability, produce geometrically interpretable transformations, and on targets with radial structure can achieve comparable quality to coupling flows with $1000\\times$ fewer parameters. We provide comprehensive evaluation on 1D and 2D benchmarks, and demonstrate applicability to higher-dimensional physics problems through experiments on $ϕ^4$ lattice field theory, where our bijections outperform affine baselines and enable problem-specific designs that address mode collapse."

  abstract: We present a systematic study of Tensor Network (TN) models $\unicode{x2013}$ Matrix Product States (MPS) and Tree Tensor Networks (TTN) $\unicode{x2013}$ for real-time jet tagging in high-energy physics, with a focus on low-latency deployment on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Motivated by the strict requirements of the HL-LHC Level-1 trigger system, we explore TNs as compact and interpretable alternatives to deep neural networks. Using low-level jet constituent features, our models achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers. We investigate post-training quantization to enable hardware-efficient implementations without degrading classification performance or latency. The best-performing models are synthesized to estimate FPGA resource usage, latency, and memory occupancy, demonstrating sub-microsecond latency and supporting the feasibility of online deployment in real-time trigger systems. Overall, this study highlights the potential of TN-based models for fast and resource-efficient inference in low-latency environments.

  abstract: This whitepaper surveys the current landscape and short- to mid-term prospects for quantum-enabled optimization and machine learning use cases in industrial settings. Grounded in the QCHALLenge program, it synthesizes hardware trajectories from different quantum architectures and providers, and assesses their maturity and potential for real-world use cases under a standardized traffic-light evaluation framework. We provide a concise summary of relevant hardware roadmaps, distinguishing superconducting and ion-trap technologies, their current states, modalities, and projected scaling trajectories. The core of the presented work are the use case evaluations in the domains of optimization problems and machine learning applications. For the conducted experiments, we apply a consistent set of evaluation criteria (model formulation, scalability, solution quality, runtime, and transferability) which are assessed in a shared system of three categories, ranging from optimistic (solutions produced by quantum computers are competitive with classical methods and/or a clear path to a quantum advantage is shown) to pessimistic (significant hurdles prevent practical application of quantum solutions now and potentially in the future). The resulting verdicts illuminate where quantum approaches currently offer promise, where hybrid classical-quantum strategies are most viable, and where classical methods are expected to remain superior.

  abstract: "We study the use of large language models (LLMs) for physics instrument design and compare their performance to reinforcement learning (RL). Using only prompting, LLMs are given task constraints and summaries of prior high-scoring designs and propose complete detector configurations, which we evaluate with the same simulators and reward functions used in RL-based optimization. Although RL yields stronger final designs, we find that modern LLMs consistently generate valid, resource-aware, and physically meaningful configurations that draw on broad pretrained knowledge of detector design principles and particle--matter interactions, despite having no task-specific training. Based on this result, as a first step toward hybrid design workflows, we explore pairing the LLMs with a dedicated trust region optimizer, serving as a precursor to future pipelines in which LLMs propose and structure design hypotheses while RL performs reward-driven optimization. Based on these experiments, we argue that LLMs are well suited as meta-planners: they can design and orchestrate RL-based optimization studies, define search strategies, and coordinate multiple interacting components within a unified workflow. In doing so, they point toward automated, closed-loop instrument design in which much of the human effort required to structure and supervise optimization can be reduced."

  abstract: In this work, we present a conditional denoising-diffusion surrogate for electromagnetic calorimeter showers that is trained to generate high-fidelity energy-deposition maps conditioned on key detector and beam parameters. The model employs efficient inference using Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model sampling and is pre-trained on GEANT4 simulations before being adapted to a new calorimeter geometry through Low-Rank Adaptation, requiring only a small post-training dataset. We evaluate physically meaningful observables, including total deposited energy, energy-weighted radius, and shower dispersion, obtaining relative root mean square error values below 2% for representative high-energy cases. This is in line with state-of-the-art calorimeter surrogates which report comparable fidelity on high-level observables. Furthermore, we compare gradients of a reconstruction-based utility function with respect to design parameters between the surrogate and finite-difference references. The diffusion surrogate reproduces the qualitative structure and directional trends of the true utility landscape, providing usable sensitivities for gradient-based optimization. These results show that diffusion-based surrogates can accelerate simulation-driven detector design while enabling differentiable, gradient-informed analysis.

  abstract: A search is conducted for standard model Higgs bosons with large transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) decaying to bottom quark pairs and produced in association with a hadronically decaying W or Z boson at the LHC. The result is based on a dataset of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector in 2016$-$2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. Boosted Higgs, W, and Z boson decays are reconstructed using large-radius jets with $p_\mathrm{T}$$\gt$ 450 GeV and identified with heavy-flavor classifiers based on a graph convolutional neural network. The observed signal strength relative to the standard model expectation is $μ$ = 0.7$2^{+0.75}_{-0.71}$ including statistical and systematic uncertainties.

  abstract: Anomaly detection methods used in a recent search for new phenomena by CMS at the CERN LHC are presented. The methods use machine learning to detect anomalous jets produced in the decay of new massive particles. The effectiveness of these approaches in enhancing sensitivity to various signals is studied and compared using data collected in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. In an example analysis, the capabilities of anomaly detection methods are further demonstrated by identifying large-radius jets consistent with Lorentz-boosted hadronically decaying top quarks in a model-agnostic framework.

  abstract: We consider a generalization of the classifier-based density-ratio estimation task to a quasiprobabilistic setting where probability densities can be negative. The problem with most loss functions used for this task is that they implicitly define a relationship between the optimal classifier and the target quasiprobabilistic density ratio which is discontinuous or not surjective. We address these problems by introducing a convex loss function that is well-suited for both probabilistic and quasiprobabilistic density ratio estimation. To quantify performance, an extended version of the Sliced-Wasserstein distance is introduced which is compatible with quasiprobability distributions. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world example from particle physics, of di-Higgs production in association with jets via gluon-gluon fusion, and achieve state-of-the-art results.

  abstract: Modern machine learning is transforming jet tagging at the LHC, but the leading transformer architectures are large, not particularly fast, and training-intensive. We present a slim version of the L-GATr tagger, reduce the number of parameters of jet-tagging transformers, and quantize them. We compare different quantization methods for standard and Lorentz-equivariant transformers and estimate their gains in resource efficiency. We find an order-of-magnitude reduction in energy cost for an moderate performance decrease, down to 1000-parameter taggers. This might be a step towards trigger-level jet tagging with small and quantized versions of the leading equivariant transformer architectures.

  abstract: We introduce ColliderML - a large, open, experiment-agnostic dataset of fully simulated and digitised proton-proton collisions in High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider conditions ($\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV, mean pile-up $μ= 200$). ColliderML provides one million events across ten Standard Model and Beyond Standard Model processes, plus extensive single-particle samples, all produced with modern next-to-leading order matrix element calculation and showering, realistic per-event pile-up overlay, a validated OpenDataDetector geometry, and standard reconstructions. The release fills a major gap for machine learning (ML) research on detector-level data, provided on the ML-friendly Hugging Face platform. We present physics coverage and the generation, simulation, digitisation and reconstruction pipeline, describe format and access, and initial collider physics benchmarks.

  abstract: In this work, we review the history and current role of global fits in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model~(BSM), including precision tests of the Standard Model (SM). Although BSM global fits were initially focused on minimal supersymmetric models, we describe how fits have evolved in response to new data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and elsewhere, expanding to encompass a broad spectrum of BSM scenarios including non-minimal supersymmetry, axion-like particles, extended Higgs sectors, dark matter models, and effective field theories such as SMEFT. We discuss how the role of global fits has shifted from forecasting possible signals of new physics at the LHC to understanding the impact of null results from LHC run-I and II and the discovery of the Higgs boson, and how interest has shifted from global fits for parameter estimation to comprehensive model comparison. We close by discussing potential trends and future applications, emphasizing the potential for machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance the efficiency of sampling algorithms and comparison between theory and experiment, as well as collaboration and software development.

  abstract: Accurate and efficient amplitude predictions are essential for precision studies of multi-jet processes at the LHC. We introduce a novel neural network architecture that predicts multi-jet amplitudes by leveraging the Catani-Seymour factorization scheme and related lower-jet amplitudes, requiring the network to learn only a correction factor. This hybrid approach combines theoretical factorization with a data-driven ansatz, enabling fast and scalable amplitude predictions. Our networks also estimate the accuracy of each prediction, allowing us to selectively use results that meet a predefined accuracy threshold. In the context of leading-order event generation, this approach achieves speed-up factors of up to 20 while maintaining all observables at the percent-level accuracy.

  abstract: We present PolySwyft, a novel, non-amortised simulation-based inference framework that unites the strengths of nested sampling (NS) and neural ratio estimation (NRE) to tackle challenging posterior distributions when the likelihood is intractable but a forward simulator is available. By nesting rounds of NRE within the exploration of NS, and employing a principled KL-divergence criterion to adaptively terminate sampling, PolySwyft achieves faster convergence on complex, multimodal targets while rigorously preserving Bayesian validity. On a suite of toy problems with analytically known posteriors of a dim(theta,D)=(5,100) multivariate Gaussian and multivariate correlated Gaussian mixture model, we demonstrate that PolySwyft recovers all modes and credible regions with fewer simulator calls than swyft's TNRE. As a real-world application, we infer cosmological parameters dim(theta,D)=(6,111) from CMB power spectra using CosmoPower. PolySwyft is released as open-source software, offering a flexible toolkit for efficient, accurate inference across the astrophysical sciences and beyond.

  abstract: Modern radio interferometers deliver large volumes of data containing high-sensitivity sky maps over wide fields-of-view. These large area observations can contain various and superposed structures such as point sources, extended objects, and large-scale diffuse emission. To fully realize the potential of these observations, it is crucial to build appropriate sky emission models which separate and reconstruct the underlying astrophysical components. We introduce aim-resolve, an automatic and iterative method that combines the Bayesian imaging algorithm resolve with deep learning and clustering algorithms in order to jointly solve the reconstruction and source extraction problem. The method identifies and models different astrophysical components in radio observations while providing uncertainty quantification of the results. By using different model descriptions for point sources, extended objects, and diffuse background emission, the method efficiently separates the individual components and improves the overall reconstruction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on synthetic image data containing multiple different sources. We further show the application of aim-resolve to an L-band (856 - 1712 MHz) MeerKAT observation of the radio galaxy ESO 137-006 and other radio galaxies in that environment. We observe a reasonable object identification for both applications, yielding a clean separation of the individual components and precise reconstructions of point sources and extended objects along with detailed uncertainty quantification. In particular, the method enables the creation of catalogs containing source positions and brightnesses and the corresponding uncertainties. The full decoupling of sky emission model and instrument response makes the method applicable to a wide variety of instruments or wavelength bands.

  abstract: "A deep-learning approach based on the transformer architecture is developed to distinguish between jets originating from quarks and gluons. The algorithm operates on jets with transverse momentum $p_{\\text{T}} > 20$ and pseudorapidity $|η| < 4.5$ and takes as input several properties derived from the jet constituents, using information from the ATLAS detector's tracker and calorimeter. The algorithm's performance is evaluated by analyzing dijet data events from proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ and $13.6$ TeV during Run 2 and Run 3 of the Large Hadron Collider. Two methods are used to obtain distributions from quark- or gluon-initiated jets in data: a matrix method fully based on Monte Carlo simulation and a new approach named `jet topics' which has less dependence on the modelling of the physics process under study. The quark and gluon identification efficiencies measured in data for the 50% quark-identification-efficiency working point vary from the simulated ones for quark-initiated (gluon-initiated) jets by factors of 0.88-1.30 (0.61-1.05) with uncertainties of 10%-70% (10%-95%). The uncertainties estimated with the jet topics method are smaller than those estimated with the matrix method, with up to 20% less systematic uncertainty in some phase-space regions. The advances in jet identification reported here provide a robust tool for precision Standard Model measurements and searches for new physics at the LHC."

  abstract: Next token prediction is an attractive pre-training task for jet foundation models, in that it is simulation free and enables excellent generative capabilities that can transfer across datasets. Here we study multiple improvements to next token prediction, building on the initial work of OmniJet-$α$. Instead of tokenizing particles and subsequently only using the token-ID as the model input for both the generative and the classification task, we adopt a hybrid setup, which allows us to use continuous feature vectors as model input while only using token-IDs in the next token prediction target. Secondly, we explore a combined pre-training strategy that combines masked particle modeling and generative learning objectives. Taken together, these changes greatly improve the performance in downstream classification tasks without any loss in generative performance.

  abstract: Gravitational-wave data analysis relies on accurate and efficient methods to extract physical information from noisy detector signals, yet the increasing rate and complexity of observations represent a growing challenge. Deep learning provides a powerful alternative to traditional inference, but existing neural models typically lack the flexibility to handle variations in data analysis settings. Such variations accommodate imperfect observations or are required for specialized tests, and could include changes in detector configurations, overall frequency ranges, or localized cuts. We introduce a flexible transformer-based architecture paired with a training strategy that enables adaptation to diverse analysis settings at inference time. Applied to parameter estimation, we demonstrate that a single flexible model -- called Dingo-T1 -- can (i) analyze 48 gravitational-wave events from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Observing Run under a wide range of analysis configurations, (ii) enable systematic studies of how detector and frequency configurations impact inferred posteriors, and (iii) perform inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency tests probing general relativity. Dingo-T1 also improves median sample efficiency on real events from a baseline of 1.4% to 4.2%. Our approach thus demonstrates flexible and scalable inference with a principled framework for handling missing or incomplete data -- key capabilities for current and next-generation observatories.

  abstract: We present hls4ml, a free and open-source platform that translates machine learning (ML) models from modern deep learning frameworks into high-level synthesis (HLS) code that can be integrated into full designs for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) or application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). With its flexible and modular design, hls4ml supports a large number of deep learning frameworks and can target HLS compilers from several vendors, including Vitis HLS, Intel oneAPI and Catapult HLS. Together with a wider eco-system for software-hardware co-design, hls4ml has enabled the acceleration of ML inference in a wide range of commercial and scientific applications where low latency, resource usage, and power consumption are critical. In this paper, we describe the structure and functionality of the hls4ml platform. The overarching design considerations for the generated HLS code are discussed, together with selected performance results.

  abstract: "Data sets that are specified by a large number of features are currently outside the area of applicability for quantum machine learning algorithms. An immediate solution to this impasse is the application of dimensionality reduction methods before passing the data to the quantum algorithm. We investigate six conventional feature extraction algorithms and five autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction models to a particle physics data set with 67 features. The reduced representations generated by these models are then used to train a quantum support vector machine for solving a binary classification problem: whether a Higgs boson is produced in proton collisions at the LHC. We show that the autoencoder methods learn a better lower-dimensional representation of the data, with the method we design, the Sinkclass autoencoder, performing 40% better than the baseline. The methods developed here open up the applicability of quantum machine learning to a larger array of data sets. Moreover, we provide a recipe for effective dimensionality reduction in this context."

  abstract: Accurate particle shower simulation remains a critical computational bottleneck for high-energy physics. Traditional Monte Carlo methods, such as Geant4, are computationally prohibitive, while existing machine learning surrogates are tied to specific detector geometries and require complete retraining for each design change or alternative detector. We present a transfer learning framework for generative calorimeter simulation models that enables adaptation across diverse geometries with high data efficiency. Using point cloud representations and pre-training on the International Large Detector detector, our approach handles new configurations without re-voxelizing showers for each geometry. On the CaloChallenge dataset, transfer learning with only 100 target-domain samples achieves a $44\%$ improvement on the geometric mean of Wasserstein distance over training from scratch. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning with bias-only adaptation achieves competitive performance while updating only $17\%$ of model parameters. Our analysis provides insight into adaptation mechanisms for particle shower development, establishing a baseline for future progress of point cloud approaches in calorimeter simulation.

  abstract: This paper presents two searches for the electroweak production of higgsinos with compressed mass spectra using 140 fb$^{-1}$ of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Events are required to feature an energetic jet, large missing transverse momentum, and at least one low-momentum charged particle that serves as a candidate higgsino decay product. In the first search, targeting higgsino mass splittings in the range of 0.3-1 GeV, the higgsinos are expected to predominantly decay into pions that are identified as low-momentum charged particles with large transverse impact parameters due to the long higgsino lifetime ($cτ\approx\mathcal{O}$(0.1-1 mm)). The second search targets larger mass splittings in the range of 1-3 GeV, where the higgsinos are expected to decay promptly into low-momentum leptons, one of which is identified by dedicated low-momentum electron or muon taggers based on neural networks utilising tracking and calorimeter information. No significant excess above the Standard Model prediction is observed in either search and the results are used to set lower limits on the masses of the higgsino-like charginos and neutralinos within a simplified model. Together, these searches exclude chargino masses below 126 GeV at 95% confidence level for mass splittings between the chargino and lightest neutralino in the range of 0.3-2 GeV, representing the first ATLAS constraints in this parameter space and surpassing the limits previously set by the LEP experiments.

  abstract: The physics programs of current and future collider experiments necessitate the development of surrogate simulators for calorimeter showers. While much progress has been made in the development of generative models for this task, they have typically been evaluated in simplified scenarios and for single particles. This is particularly true for the challenging task of highly granular calorimeter simulation. For the first time, this work studies the use of highly granular generative calorimeter surrogates in a realistic simulation application. We introduce DDML, a generic library which enables the combination of generative calorimeter surrogates with realistic detectors implemented using the DD4hep toolkit. We compare two different generative models - one operating on a regular grid representation, and the other using a less common point cloud approach. In order to disentangle methodological details from model performance, we provide comparisons to idealized simulators which directly sample representations of different resolutions from the full simulation ground-truth. We then systematically evaluate model performance on post-reconstruction benchmarks for electromagnetic shower simulation. Beginning with a typical single particle study, we introduce a first multi-particle benchmark based on di-photon separations, before studying a first full-physics benchmark based on hadronic decays of the tau lepton. Our results indicate that models operating on a point cloud can achieve a favorable balance between speed and accuracy for highly granular calorimeter simulation compared to those which operate on a regular grid representation.

  abstract: We present the $N$-fit algorithm designed to improve the reconstruction of neutrino events detected by a single line of the ANTARES underwater telescope, usually associated with low energy neutrino events ($\sim$ 100 GeV). $N$-Fit is a neural network model that relies on deep learning and combines several advanced techniques in machine learning --deep convolutional layers, mixture density output layers, and transfer learning. This framework divides the reconstruction process into two dedicated branches for each neutrino event topology --tracks and showers-- composed of sub-models for spatial estimation --direction and position-- and energy inference, which later on are combined for event classification. Regarding the direction of single-line events, the $N$-Fit algorithm significantly refines the estimation of the zenithal angle, and delivers reliable azimuthal angle predictions that were previously unattainable with traditional $χ^2$-fit methods. Improving on energy estimation of single-line events is a tall order; $N$-Fit benefits from transfer learning to efficiently integrate key characteristics, such as the estimation of the closest distance from the event to the detector. $N$-Fit also takes advantage from transfer learning in event topology classification by freezing convolutional layers of the pretrained branches. Tests on Monte Carlo simulations and data demonstrate a significant reduction in mean and median absolute errors across all reconstructed parameters. The improvements achieved by $N$-Fit highlight its potential for advancing multimessenger astrophysics and enhancing our ability to probe fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model using single-line events from ANTARES data.

  abstract: "Beyond the practical goal of improving search and measurement sensitivity through better jet tagging algorithms, there is a deeper question: what are their upper performance limits? Generative surrogate models with learned likelihood functions offer a new approach to this problem, provided the surrogate correctly captures the underlying data distribution. In this work, we introduce the SUrrogate ReFerence (SURF) method, a new approach to validating generative models. This framework enables exact Neyman-Pearson tests by training the target model on samples from another tractable surrogate, which is itself trained on real data. We argue that the EPiC-FM generative model is a valid surrogate reference for JetClass jets and apply SURF to show that modern jet taggers may already be operating close to the true statistical limit. By contrast, we find that autoregressive GPT models unphysically exaggerate top vs. QCD separation power encoded in the surrogate reference, implying that they are giving a misleading picture of the fundamental limit."

  abstract: A search for heavy resonances decaying into a Higgs boson (H) or a Z boson and a photon ($γ$), with the H or Z bosons decaying to a bottom quark-antiquark pair ($\mathrm{b\bar{b}}$) is presented. The analysis is performed using proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The analyzed events contain a photon and a massive large-radius jet originating from a Lorentz-boosted $\mathrm{b\bar{b}}$ system. An advanced transformer-based algorithm classifies jets according to their substructure and quark flavors, forming a tagger that identifies jets as candidates from H/Z $\to$$\mathrm{b\bar{b}}$ decays. A set of parametric functions is used to fit the photon-jet invariant mass spectrum and to extract potential signals. No significant excess is observed above the standard model expectations. The results set upper limits at 95% confidence level on the product of the cross section and the branching fraction for spin-1 H$γ$ resonances and spin-0 Z$γ$ resonances, below 0.1 and 0.3 fb, respectively, representing the most stringent limits to date.

  abstract: Anomaly detection has the potential to discover new physics in unexplored regions of the data. However, choosing the best anomaly detector for a given data set in a model-agnostic way is an important challenge which has hitherto largely been neglected. In this paper, we introduce the data-driven ARGOS metric, which has a sound theoretical foundation and is empirically shown to robustly select the most sensitive anomaly detection model given the data. Focusing on weakly-supervised, classifier-based anomaly detection methods, we show that the ARGOS metric outperforms other model selection metrics previously used in the literature, in particular the binary cross-entropy loss. We explore several realistic applications, including hyperparameter tuning as well as architecture and feature selection, and in all cases we demonstrate that ARGOS is robust to the noisy conditions of anomaly detection.

  abstract: Low latency event-selection (trigger) algorithms are essential components of Large Hadron Collider (LHC) operation. Modern machine learning (ML) models have shown great offline performance as classifiers and could improve trigger performance, thereby improving downstream physics analyses. However, inference on such large models does not satisfy the $40\text{MHz}$ online latency constraint at the LHC. In this work, we propose \texttt{PHAZE}, a novel framework built on cryptographic techniques like hashing and zero-knowledge machine learning (zkML) to achieve low latency inference, via a certifiable, early-exit mechanism from an arbitrarily large baseline model. We lay the foundations for such a framework to achieve nanosecond-order latency and discuss its inherent advantages, such as built-in anomaly detection, within the scope of LHC triggers, as well as its potential to enable a dynamic low-level trigger in the future.

  abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) propagating through the universe can be microlensed by stellar and intermediate-mass objects. Lensing induces frequency-dependent amplification of GWs, which can be computed using \texttt{GLoW}, an accurate code suitable for evaluating this factor for generic lens models and arbitrary impact parameters depending on the lens configuration. For parameter inference, we employ the DINGO algorithm, a machine learning framework based on neural posterior estimation, a simulation-based inference method that uses normalizing flows to efficiently approximate posterior distributions of the physical parameters. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that it enables efficient parameter estimation of diffracted GW signals using an isolated point mass lens model. This method can be useful for rapidly identifying microlensed events within large GW catalogs and for conducting population studies of compact binaries. Compared to traditional parameter estimation techniques, we find that combining DINGO with importance sampling can provide efficient estimation of the background Bayes-factor distribution, which is required in evaluating the significance of candidate lensed events. However, for foreground (lensed) events, care must be taken, as sampling efficiency can decrease when the lensed data lie outside the distribution learned by the unlensed DINGO network. Our framework can be naturally extended to more complex and realistic lens models, allowing detailed analyses of the microlensed GWs.

  abstract: Connecting the formation and evolution of galaxies to the large-scale structure is crucial for interpreting cosmological observations. While hydrodynamical simulations accurately model the correlated properties of galaxies, they are computationally prohibitive to run over volumes that match modern surveys. We address this by developing a framework to rapidly generate mock galaxy catalogs conditioned on inexpensive dark-matter-only simulations. We present a multi-modal, transformer-based model that takes 3D dark matter density and velocity fields as input, and outputs a corresponding point cloud of galaxies with their physical properties. We demonstrate that our trained model faithfully reproduces a variety of galaxy summary statistics and correctly captures their variation with changes in the underlying cosmological and astrophysical parameters, making it the first accelerated forward model to capture all the relevant galaxy properties, their full spatial distribution, and their conditional dependencies in hydrosimulations.

  abstract: "A tau lepton identification algorithm,DeepTau, based on convolutionalneural network techniques, has been developed in the CMS experimentto discriminate reconstructed hadronic decays of tau leptons(τ$_{h}$) from quark or gluon jets andelectrons and muons that are misreconstructed asτ$_{h}$ candidates. The latest version ofthis algorithm, v2.5, includes domain adaptation by backpropagation,a technique that reduces discrepancies between collision data andsimulation in the region with the highest purity of genuineτ$_{h}$ candidates. Additionally, arefined training workflow improves classification performance withrespect to the previous version of the algorithm, with a reductionof 30–50% in the probability for quark and gluon jets to bemisidentified as τ$_{h}$ candidates forgiven reconstruction and identification efficiencies. This paperpresents the novel improvements introduced in theDeepTau algorithm and evaluatesits performance in LHC proton-proton collision data at √(s) = 13and 13.6 TeV collected in 2018 and 2022 withintegrated luminosities of 60 and35 fb$^{-1}$, respectively. Techniques tocalibrate the performance of the τ$_{h}$\_identification algorithm in simulation with respect to its measuredperformance in real data are presented, together with a subset ofresults among those measured for use in CMS physics analyses."

  abstract: We introduce theoretically grounded Continuous Semi-Quantum Boltzmann Machines (CSQBMs) that supports continuous-action reinforcement learning. By combining exponential-family priors over visible units with quantum Boltzmann distributions over hidden units, CSQBMs yield a hybrid quantum-classical model that reduces qubit requirements while retaining strong expressiveness. Crucially, gradients with respect to continuous variables can be computed analytically, enabling direct integration into Actor-Critic algorithms. Building on this, we propose a continuous Q-learning framework that replaces global maximization by efficient sampling from the CSQBM distribution, thereby overcoming instability issues in continuous control.

  abstract: We introduce Accelerated Sequential Posterior Inference via Reuse (ASPIRE), a broadly applicable framework that transforms existing posterior samples and Bayesian evidence estimates into unbiased results under alternative models without rerunning the original analysis. ASPIRE combines normalizing flows with a generalized Sequential Monte Carlo scheme, enabling efficient updates of existing results and reducing the computational cost of reanalyses by 4-10 times. This addresses a growing problem in gravitational-wave astronomy, where events must be repeatedly reanalyzed under different models or physical hypotheses. We show that ASPIRE reproduces full Bayesian results when switching waveform models or adding physical effects such as spin precession and orbital eccentricity. With this statistical robustness, ASPIRE turns repeated reanalyses into fast, reliable updatespaving the way for systematic studies of waveform systematics, scalable reanalyses across large event catalogs, and broadly applicable Bayesian reanalysis across other scientific domains.

  abstract: We present CaloClouds3, a model for the fast simulation of photon showers in the barrel of a high granularity detector. This iteration demonstrates for the first time how a pointcloud model can employ angular conditioning to replicate photons at all incident angles. Showers produced by this model can be used across the whole detector barrel, due to specially produced position agnostic training data. With this flexibility, the model is usable in a full simulation and reconstruction chain, which offers a further handle for evaluating physics performance of the model. As inference time is a crucial consideration for a generative model, the pre-processing and hyperparameters are aggressively optimised, achieving a speed up factor of two orders of magnitude over Geant4 at inference.

  abstract: A search for single production of a vector-like T quark with charge 2$e$/3, decaying to a top quark and a neutral scalar boson is presented. The boson can be a standard model Higgs boson (H) or a new scalar boson ($ϕ$). In the first case, a branching fraction of 25% is assumed for the decay T $\to$ tH, while in the second case the T quark is assumed to decay exclusively to t$ϕ$. The top quark is identified via its lepton+jets decay, and the neutral boson via its decay into a bottom quark-antiquark pair. Final states with Lorentz-boosted topologies are considered and machine-learning techniques are exploited for optimal event classification. The analysis uses data collected by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$ recorded at the CERN LHC in 2016$-$2018. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the product of cross section and branching fraction for a T quark in a narrow-width approximation. They vary between 14.8 and 0.1 fb, for T quark masses in the range 1$-$3 TeV and $ϕ$ boson masses in the range 25$-$250 GeV. These are the first exclusion limits set on the production of a single T quark decaying into a top quark and a new neutral scalar boson. For the decay channel into a top quark and a standard model Higgs boson, the results provide the best limits on production cross sections to date, for T quark masses above 2 TeV.

  abstract: Unfolding, for example of distortions imparted by detectors, provides suitable and publishable representations of LHC data. Many methods for unbinned and high-dimensional unfolding using machine learning have been proposed, but no generative method scales to the several hundred dimensions necessary to fully characterize LHC collisions. This paper proposes a 3-stage generative unfolding framework that is capable of unfolding several hundred dimensions. It is effective to unfold the jet-level kinematics as well as the full substructure of light-flavor jets and of top jets, and is the first generative unfolding study to achieve high precision on high-dimensional jet substructure.

  abstract: "Machine learning has the potential to improve the reconstruction of the dark matter profile of galaxies with respect to traditional methods, like rotation curves. We demonstrate on the simulation suite Illustris-TNG that a steerable equivariant convolutional neural network (CNN) is able to infer the dark matter profiles within and around individual galaxies from photometric and interferometric data, improving on a standard CNN. Within the in silico environment of the simulations, our architecture is able to capture the dark matter distribution within galaxies without a parametrization of the profile. We perform an interpretability analysis to understand the internal mechanisms of the trained model and the most important data features used to estimate the dark matter profiles. The equivariant CNN recovers the dark matter profile of galaxies within the stellar mass range $[10^{10} - 10^{12} ]$$M_{\\odot}$ with excellent precision and accuracy: the mean squared error is reduced by a factor of ~ 3 from its value under the training distribution, demonstrating that the network has learnt from the data features. While this holds within the controlled 'in silico' environment of the simulation, we argue that few additional steps are needed before this method can be reliably applied to galaxies in the real field observations."

  abstract: "Simulation-based inference (SBI) is emerging as a new statistical paradigm for addressing complex scientific inference problems. By leveraging the representational power of deep neural networks, SBI can extract the most informative simulation features for the parameters of interest. Sequential SBI methods extend this approach by iteratively steering the simulation process towards the most relevant regions of parameter space. This is typically implemented through an algorithmic structure, in which simulation and network training alternate over multiple rounds. This strategy is particularly well suited for high-precision inference in high-dimensional settings, which are commonplace in physics applications with growing data volumes and increasing model fidelity. Here, we introduce dynamic SBI, which implements the core ideas of sequential methods in a round-free, asynchronous, and highly parallelisable manner. At its core is an adaptive dataset that is iteratively transformed during inference to resemble the target observation. Simulation and training proceed in parallel: trained networks are used both to filter out simulations incompatible with the data and to propose new, more promising ones. Compared to round-based sequential methods, this asynchronous structure can significantly reduce simulation costs and training overhead. We demonstrate that dynamic SBI achieves significant improvements in simulation and training efficiency while maintaining inference performance. We further validate our framework on two challenging astrophysical inference tasks: characterising the stochastic gravitational wave background and analysing strong gravitational lensing systems. Overall, this work presents a flexible and efficient new paradigm for sequential SBI."

  abstract: The advent of Stage IV galaxy redshift surveys such as DESI and Euclid marks the beginning of an era of precision cosmology, with one key objective being the detection of primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG), potential signatures of inflationary physics. In particular, constraining the amplitude of local-type PNG, parameterised by $f_{\rm NL}$, with $σ_{f_{\rm NL}} \sim 1$, would provide a critical test of single versus multi-field inflation scenarios. While current large-scale structure and cosmic microwave background analyses have achieved $σ_{f_{\rm NL}} \sim 5$-$9$, further improvements demand novel data compression strategies. We propose a hybrid estimator that hierarchically combines standard $2$-point and $3$-point statistics with a field-level neural summary, motivated by recent theoretical work that shows that such a combination is nearly optimal, disentangling primordial from late-time non-Gaussianity. We employ PatchNet, a convolutional neural network that extracts small-scale information from sub-volumes (patches) of the halo number density field while large-scale information is retained via the power spectrum and bispectrum. Using Quijote-PNG simulations, we evaluate the Fisher information of this combined estimator across various redshifts, halo mass cuts, and scale cuts. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of patch-based field-level compression always enhances constraints on $f_{\rm NL}$, reaching gains of $30$-$45\%$ at low $k_{\rm max}$ ($\sim 0.1 \, h \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$), and capturing information beyond the bispectrum. This approach offers a computationally efficient and scalable pathway to tighten the PNG constraints from forthcoming survey data.

  abstract: "We present Qiboml, an open-source software library for orchestrating quantum and classical components in hybrid machine learning workflows. Building on Qibo's quantum computing capabilities and integrating with popular machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, Qiboml enables the construction of quantum and hybrid models that can run on a broad range of backends: (i) multi-threaded CPUs, GPUs, and multi-GPU systems for simulation with statevector or tensor network methods; (ii) quantum processing units, both on-premise and through cloud providers. In this paper, we showcase its functionalities, including diverse simulation options, noise-aware simulations, and real-time error mitigation and calibration."

  abstract: Measurements in the highly Lorentz-boosted regime provokeincreased interest in probing the Higgs boson properties and insearching for particles beyond the standard model at the LHC. Inthe CMS Collaboration, various boosted-object tagging algorithms,designed to identify hadronic jets originating from a massiveparticle decaying to bb̅ orcc̅, have been developedand deployed across a range of physics analyses. This paperhighlights their performance on simulated events, and summarizesnovel calibration techniques using proton-proton collision datacollected at √(s) = 13 TeV during the 2016–2018 LHCdata-taking period. Three dedicated methods are used for thecalibration in multijet events, leveraging either machine learningtechniques, the presence of muons within energetic boosted jets, orthe reconstruction of hadronically decaying high-energyZ bosons. The calibration results, obtainedthrough a combination of these approaches, are presented anddiscussed.

  abstract: Event reconstruction at the LHC, the task of assigning observed physics objects to their true origins, is a central challenge for precision measurements and searches. Many existing machine learning approaches address this problem but rely on a single event topology, restricting their applicability to realistic analyses where multiple signal and background processes with different structures are present. To overcome this, we present TIGER, a novel hierarchical graph network that is fundamentally topology agnostic. By incorporating only the common underlying structure of sequential two-body decays, our model can reconstruct complex events without process-specific assumptions. This flexible architecture supports multitask learning, enabling simultaneous event reconstruction and classification. TIGER thus provides a powerful and generalizable tool for physics analysis at the LHC.

  abstract: Theories with a sign problem due to a complex action or Boltzmann weight can sometimes be numerically solved using a stochastic process in the complexified configuration space. However, the probability distribution effectively sampled by this complex Langevin process is not known a priori and notoriously hard to understand. In generative AI, diffusion models can learn distributions, or their log derivatives, from data. We explore the ability of diffusion models to learn the distributions sampled by a complex Langevin process, comparing score-based and energy-based diffusion models, and speculate about possible applications.

  abstract: We propose a novel use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as unsupervised anomaly detectors in particle physics. Using lightweight LLM-like networks with encoder-based architectures trained to reconstruct background events via masked-token prediction, our method identifies anomalies through deviations in reconstruction performance, without prior knowledge of signal characteristics. Applied to searches for simultaneous four-top-quark production, this token-based approach shows competitive performance against established unsupervised methods and effectively captures subtle discrepancies in collider data, suggesting a promising direction for model-independent searches for new physics.

  abstract: High-Energy Physics experiments are rapidly escalating in generated data volume, a trend that will intensify with the upcoming High-Luminosity LHC upgrade. This surge in data necessitates critical revisions across the data processing pipeline, with particle track reconstruction being a prime candidate for improvement. In our previous work, we introduced "TrackFormers", a collection of Transformer-based one-shot encoder-only models that effectively associate hits with expected tracks. In this study, we extend our earlier efforts by incorporating loss functions that account for inter-hit correlations, conducting detailed investigations into (various) Transformer attention mechanisms, and a study on the reconstruction of higher-level objects. Furthermore we discuss new datasets that allow the training on hit level for a range of physics processes. These developments collectively aim to boost both the accuracy, and potentially the efficiency of our tracking models, offering a robust solution to meet the demands of next-generation high-energy physics experiments.

  abstract: The High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will reach luminosities up to 7 times higher than the previous run, yielding denser events and larger occupancies. Next generation trigger algorithms must retain reliable selection within a strict latency budget. This work explores machine-learning approaches for future muon triggers, using the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer as a benchmark. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used as a reference, while a Graph Neural Network (GNN) is introduced as a natural model for sparse detector data. Preliminary single-track studies show that GNNs achieve high efficiency with compact architectures, an encouraging result in view of FPGA deployment.

  abstract: Calorimeter shower simulations are computationally expensive, and generative models offer an efficient alternative. However, achieving a balance between accuracy and speed remains a challenge, with distribution tail modeling being a key limitation. Invertible generative network CaloINN provides a trade-off between simulation quality and efficiency. The ongoing study targets introducing a set of post-processing modifications of analysis-level observables aimed at improving the accuracy of distribution tails. As part of interTwin project initiative developing an open-source Digital Twin Engine, we implemented the CaloINN within the interTwin AI framework.

  abstract: The increasing volume of gamma-ray data demands new analysis approaches that can handle large-scale datasets while providing robustness for source detection. We present a Deep Learning (DL) based pipeline for detection, localization, and characterization of gamma-ray sources. We extend our AutoSourceID (ASID) method, initially tested with \textit{Fermi}-LAT simulated data and optical data (MeerLICHT), to Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) simulated data. This end-to-end pipeline demonstrates a versatile framework for future application to other surveys and potentially serves as a building block for a foundational model for astrophysical source detection.

  abstract: This competition in high-energy physics (HEP) and machine learning was the first to strongly emphasise uncertainties in $(H \rightarrow τ^+ τ^-)$ cross-section measurement. Participants were tasked with developing advanced analysis techniques capable of dealing with uncertainties in the input training data and providing credible confidence intervals. The accuracy of these intervals was evaluated using pseudo-experiments to assess correct coverage. The dataset is now published in Zenodo, and the winning submissions are fully documented.

  abstract: Future high-luminosity hadron colliders demand tracking detectors with extreme radiation tolerance, high spatial precision, and sub-nanosecond timing. 3D diamond pixel sensors offer these capabilities due to diamond's radiation hardness and high carrier mobility. Conductive electrodes, produced via femtosecond IR laser pulses, exhibit high resistivity that delays signal propagation. This effect necessitates extending the classical Ramo-Shockley weighting potential formalism. We model the phenomenon through a 3rd-order, 3+1D PDE derived as a quasi-stationary approximation of Maxwell's equations. The PDE is solved numerically and coupled with charge transport simulations for realistic 3D sensor geometries. A Mixture-of-Experts Physics-Informed Neural Network, trained on Spectral Method data, provides a meshless solver to assess timing degradation from electrode resistance.

  abstract: "We study star formation over 12 Gyr using pop-cosmos, a generative model trained on 26-band photometry of 420,000 COSMOS2020 galaxies (IRAC Ch.1 $<26$). The model learns distributions over 16 SPS parameters via score-based diffusion, matching observed colours and magnitudes. We compute the star formation rate density (SFRD) to $z=3.5$ by directly integrating individual galaxy SFRs. The SFRD peaks at $z=1.3\\pm0.1$, with peak value $0.08\\pm0.01$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. We classify star-forming (SF) and quiescent (Q) galaxies using specific SFR $<10^{-11}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparing with $NUVrJ$ colour selection. The sSFR criterion yields up to 20% smaller quiescent fractions across $0<z<3.5$, with $NUVrJ$-selected samples contaminated by galaxies with sSFR up to $10^{-9}$ yr$^{-1}$. Our sSFR-selected stellar mass function shows a negligible number density of low-mass ($<10^{9.5}$ M$_\\odot$) Q galaxies at $z\\sim1$, where colour-selection shows a prominent increase. Non-parametric star formation histories around the SFRD peak reveal distinct patterns: SF galaxies show gradually decreasing SFR correlations with lookback time ($r\\sim1$ to $r\\sim0$ over 13 Gyr), implying increasingly stochastic star formation toward early epochs. Q galaxies exhibit full correlation ($r>0.95$) during the most recent $\\sim$300 Myr, then sharp decorrelation with earlier star-forming epochs, marking clear quenching transitions. Massive ($10<\\log_{10}(M_*/$M$_{\\odot})<11$) galaxies quench on a time-scale of $\\sim1$ Gyr, with mass assembly concentrated in their first 3.5 Gyr. Finally, AGN activity (infrared luminosity) peaks as massive ($\\sim10^{10.5}$ M$_\\odot$) galaxies approach the transition between star-forming and quiescent states, declining sharply once quiescence is established. This provides evidence that AGN feedback operates in a critical regime during the $\\sim1$ Gyr quenching transition."

  abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs), hypothetical pseudoscalar particles that couple to photons, are among the most actively investigated candidates for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Their interaction with gamma rays in the presence of astrophysical magnetic fields can leave characteristic, energy-dependent modulations in observed spectra. Capturing such subtle features requires precise statistical inference, but standard likelihood-based methods often fall short when faced with complex models, large number of nuisance parameters and limited analytical tractability. In this work, we investigate the application of simulation-based inference (SBI), specifically Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE), to constrain ALP parameters using simulated observations from the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). We model the gamma-ray emission from the active galactic nucleus NGC 1275, accounting for photon-ALP mixing, extragalactic background light (EBL) absorption, and the full CTAO instrument response. Leveraging the Swyft framework, we infer posteriors for the ALP mass and coupling strength and demonstrate its potential to extract meaningful constraints on ALPs from future real gamma-ray data with CTAO.

  abstract: The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is an international observatory currentlyunder construction, which will consist of two sites (one in the Northern Hemisphere and one in theSouthern Hemisphere). It will eventually be the largest and most sensitive ground-based gamma-ray observatory. In the meantime, a small subarray composed of four Large-Sized Telescopes(LSTs) at the Northern site will begin collecting data in the coming year. In preparation, wepresent a stereoscopic event reconstruction using graph neural networks (GNNs) to combineinformation from several telescopes of this subarray. In our previous work, we explored the use ofGNNs for the stereoscopic reconstruction of gamma-ray events on simulated data from the Prod5sample and showed that GNNs provide a better stereoscopic reconstruction. We now compare thisapproach to the currently foreseen method that analytically combines the output of monoscopicrandom forests, and explore how GNNs can be used in fusion with the Random forest algorithmin order to provide a more sensitive stereoscopic system.

  abstract: Accurate assessment of systematic uncertainties is an increasingly vital task in physics studies, where large, high-dimensional datasets, like those collected at the Large Hadron Collider, hold the key to new discoveries. Common approaches to assessing systematic uncertainties rely on simplifications, such as assuming that the impact of the various sources of uncertainty factorizes. In this paper, we provide realistic example scenarios in which this assumption fails. We introduce an algorithm that uses Gaussian process regression to estimate the impact of systematic uncertainties \textit{without} assuming factorization. The Gaussian process models are enhanced with derivative information, which increases the accuracy of the regression without increasing the number of samples. In addition, we present a novel sampling strategy based on Bayesian experimental design, which is shown to be more efficient than random and grid sampling in our example scenarios.

  abstract: Experimental studies of beauty hadron decays face significant challenges due to a wide range of backgrounds arising from the numerous possible decay channels with similar final states. For a particular signal decay, the process for ascertaining the most relevant background processes necessitates a detailed analysis of final state particles, potential misidentifications, and kinematic overlaps, which, due to computational limitations, is restricted to the simulation of only the most relevant backgrounds. Moreover, this process typically relies on the physicist's intuition and expertise, as no systematic method exists. This paper has two primary goals. First, from a particle physics perspective, we present a novel approach that utilises Reinforcement Learning (RL) to overcome the aforementioned challenges by systematically determining the critical backgrounds affecting beauty hadron decay measurements. While beauty hadron physics serves as the case study in this work, the proposed strategy is broadly adaptable to other types of particle physics measurements. Second, from a Machine Learning perspective, we introduce a novel algorithm which exploits the synergy between RL and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for environments with highly sparse rewards and a large trajectory space. This strategy leverages GAs to efficiently explore the trajectory space and identify successful trajectories, which are used to guide the RL agent's training. Our method also incorporates a transformer architecture for the RL agent to handle token sequences representing decays.

  abstract: "This paper presents a search for new physics through the process where a massive particle, X, decays into a Higgs boson and a second particle, Y. The Higgs boson subsequently decays into a bottom quark–antiquark pair, which is reconstructed as a single large-radius jet. The decay products of Yare also assumed to produce a single large-radius jet. The identification of the Yparticle is enhanced by computing the anomaly score of its candidate jet using an autoencoder, which measures deviations from typical quark- or gluon-induced jets. This allows a simultaneous search for multiple Ydecay scenarios within a single analysis. In the main benchmark process, Yis a scalar particle that decays into a Wboson pair. Two other scalar Ydecay processes are also considered as benchmarks: decays to a light quark–antiquark pair, and decays to a top quark–antiquark pair. A fourth benchmark process considers Yas a hadronically decaying top quark, arising from the decay of a vector-like quark into a top quark and a Higgs boson. Data recorded by the CMS experiment at a center-of-mass energy of 13$\\,\\text {Te}\\hspace{-.08em}\\text {V}$ in 2016–2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138$\\,\\text {fb}^{-1}$, are analyzed. The search covers Xmasses between 1.4 and 3.0$\\,\\text {Te}\\hspace{-.08em}\\text {V}$ and Ymasses between 90 and 400$\\,\\text {Ge}\\hspace{-.08em}\\text {V}$, with all simulated signals produced in the narrow-width approximation. No significant excess above the standard model background expectation is observed. The most stringent upper limits to date are placed on benchmark signal cross sections for various masses of X and Y particles"

  abstract: We demonstrate a GPU-accelerated nested sampling framework for efficient high-dimensional Bayesian inference in cosmology. Using JAX-based neural emulators and likelihoods for cosmic microwave background and cosmic shear analyses, our approach provides parameter constraints and direct calculation of Bayesian evidence. In the 39-dimensional $Λ$CDM vs $w_0w_a$ shear analysis, we produce Bayes factors and a robust error bar in just 2 days on a single A100 GPU, without loss of accuracy. Where CPU-based nested sampling can now be outpaced by methods relying on MCMC sampling and decoupled evidence estimation, we demonstrate that with GPU acceleration nested sampling offers the necessary speed-up to put it on equal computational footing with these methods, especially where reliable model comparison is paramount. We also explore interpolation in the matter power spectrum for cosmic shear analysis, finding a further factor of 4 speed-up with consistent posterior contours and Bayes factor. We put forward both nested and gradient-based sampling as useful tools for the modern cosmologist, where cutting-edge inference pipelines can yield orders of magnitude improvements in computation time.

  abstract: "Precision cosmology with Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) requires robust quality control of large, heterogeneous datasets. Current data processing often relies on manual, subjective rejection of photometric data, a practice that is not scalable for forthcoming surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We present a Bayesian framework that automates this step by integrating anomaly detection directly into the light curve fitting process. While the framework is model-agnostic and compatible with any spectral energy distribution (SED) model, here we demonstrate its application with the SALT3 model, implemented fully on GPU using \\texttt{JAX-bandflux} for computational efficiency. Our method models the probability of each photometric measurement being anomalous with respect to the model, simultaneously inferring the physical supernova parameters and each data point's posterior probability of being a contaminant. Applying this framework to the Hawaii Supernova Flows dataset, we demonstrate its three principal capabilities: (i) robust mitigation of isolated outliers; (ii) automated identification and rejection of entirely corrupted bandpasses; and (iii) preservation of valid data by flagging only specific anomalous points within otherwise usable filters. We also find that contaminants are systematically brighter and bluer, which if uncorrected could bias subsequent cosmological inference."

  abstract: At hadron colliders, the net transverse momentum of particles that do not interact with the detector (missing transverse momentum, $\vec{p}_\mathrm{T}^\text{miss}$) is a crucial observable in many analyses. In the standard model, $\vec{p}_\mathrm{T}^\text{miss}$ originates from neutrinos. Many beyond-the-standard-model particles, such as dark matter candidates, are also expected to leave the experimental apparatus undetected. This paper presents a novel $\vec{p}_\mathrm{T}^\text{miss}$ estimator, DeepMET, which is based on deep neural networks that were developed by the CMS Collaboration at the LHC. The DeepMET algorithm produces a weight for each reconstructed particle based on its properties. The estimator is based on the negative vector sum of the weighted transverse momenta of all reconstructed particles in an event. Compared with other estimators currently employed by CMS, DeepMET improves the $\vec{p}_\mathrm{T}^\text{miss}$ resolution by 10$-$30%, shows improvement for a wide range of final states, is easier to train, and is more resilient against the effects of additional proton-proton interactions accompanying the collision of interest.

  abstract: "We present a new extraction of unpolarized Dihadron Fragmentation Functions, which describe the probability density for an unpolarized parton to fragment into a π$^{+}$π$^{−}$ pair. Our analysis is based on data from the BELLE collaboration. We improve on previous determinations in several key aspects: we employ state-of-the-art perturbative QCD calculations up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO); we limit the use of Monte Carlo event generators to estimating the relative contributions of different flavors, a necessary input due to the limited flavor sensitivity of the available data; and, in addition to a traditional fit based on a physics-informed functional form, we explore a Neural Network parametrization. This latter approach paves the way for more robust and flexible determinations of Dihadron Fragmentation Functions using machine learning techniques."

  abstract: The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is one of the intriguing mysteries in astroparticle physics.In order to identify their sources, we need precise knowledge of the mass composition of UHECRs.The direct detection of UHECRs is not feasible at energies above 0.1 PeV, necessitating the use of mass-sensitive observables of extended air showers induced by UHECRs interacting with the atmosphere.One way to achieve high statistics for these mass-sensitive observables is to use ground-based detector arrays, such as the Surface Detector (SD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory.The SD consists of three sub-arrays of independent detector stations arranged in triangular grids with different spacings.Recently, it has been shown that neural networks (NNs) can extract mass-sensitive observables from data taken by the SD-1500, the largest sub-detector of the SD.In this contribution, we demonstrate the feasibility of using NNs to reconstruct a high-level shower observable, the depth of the shower maximum, from data simulated for and observed by the SD-750, the second-largest detector array nested within the SD-1500.A simulation study shows that the SD-750 NN exhibits behavior similar to that of an SD-1500 NN and outperforms the latter in the energy range [1, 10) EeV.Moreover, we show that, after performing a correction and calibration procedure, the predictions of the SD-750 NN are consistent with the measurement of the depth of the shower maximum obtained by the Fluorescence Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory.

  abstract: "The substantial data volumes encountered in modern particle physics and other domains of fundamental physics research allow (and require) the use of increasingly complex data analysis tools and workflows. While the use of machine learning (ML) tools for data analysis has recently proliferated, these tools are typically special-purpose algorithms that rely, for example, on encoded physics knowledge to reach optimal performance. In this work, we investigate a new and orthogonal direction: Using recent progress in large language models (LLMs) to create a team of agents -- instances of LLMs with specific subtasks -- that jointly solve data analysis-based research problems in a way similar to how a human researcher might: by creating code to operate standard tools and libraries (including ML systems) and by building on results of previous iterations. If successful, such agent-based systems could be deployed to automate routine analysis components to counteract the increasing complexity of modern tool chains. To investigate the capabilities of current-generation commercial LLMs, we consider the task of anomaly detection via the publicly available and highly-studied LHC Olympics dataset. Several current models by OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5) are investigated and their stability tested. Overall, we observe the capacity of the agent-based system to solve this data analysis problem. The best agent-created solutions mirror the performance of human state-of-the-art results."

  abstract: A model-independent measurement of the differential production cross section of the Higgs boson decaying into a pair of W bosons, with a final state including two jets produced in association, is presented. In the analysis, events are selected in which the decay products of the two W bosons consist of an electron, a muon, and missing transverse momentum. The model independence of the measurement is maximized by making use of a discriminating variable that is agnostic to the signal hypothesis developed through machine learning. The analysis is based on proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector from 2012$-$2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The production cross section is measured as a function of the difference in azimuthal angle between the two jets. The differential cross section measurements are used to constrain Higgs boson couplings within the standard model effective field theory framework.

  abstract: The complexity of large-scale 6G-and-beyond networks demands innovative approaches for multi-objective optimization over vast search spaces, a task often intractable. Quantum computing (QC) emerges as a promising technology for efficient large-scale optimization. We present our vision of leveraging QC to tackle key classes of problems in future mobile networks. By analyzing and identifying common features, particularly their graph-centric representation, we propose a unified strategy involving QC algorithms. Specifically, we outline a methodology for optimization using quantum annealing as well as quantum reinforcement learning. Additionally, we discuss the main challenges that QC algorithms and hardware must overcome to effectively optimize future networks.

  abstract: High-multiplicity events remain a bottleneck for LHC simulations due to their computational cost. We present a ML-surrogate approach to accelerate matrix element reweighting from leading-color (LC) to full-color (FC) accuracy, building on recent advancements in LC event generation. Comparing a variety of modern network architectures for representative QCD processes, we achieve speed-up of around a factor two over the current LC-to-FC baseline. We also show how transformers learn and exploit underlying symmetries, to improve generalization. Given the gained trust in trained networks and developments in learned uncertainties, the LC-to-FC approach will eventually benefit further from not needing a final classic unweighting step.

  abstract: Simulation-based inference has been shown to outperform traditional, histogram-based inference in numerous phenomenological and experimental studies. So far, these analyses have focused on individual high-profile processes. We study the combination of four different di-boson processes in terms of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory. Our results demonstrate how simulation-based inference also wins over traditional methods for global LHC analyses.

  abstract: The discovery of gravitational waves (GWs) from merging compact binaries has transformed modern astrophysics, driving innovation in detection methodologies. Whereas matched-filtering techniques have long been the standard, the growing volume of data from advanced observatories like LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA has spurred interest in machine learning (ML) solutions for their scalability and computational efficiency. As next-generation detectors approach reality, the development of reliable and adaptable search algorithms becomes increasingly urgent. This work examines the consistency of detection sensitivity in AresGW model 1, an ML-based pipeline, when applied to multiple month-long datasets consisting of real detector noise. By analyzing the number of waveform injections detected and the sensitive distance at different FAR thresholds, we evaluate the model's performance under low false alarm rates and investigate how sensitivity metrics fluctuate due to dataset variability. In addition, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm on data both with and without contamination of genuine GW signals. Our findings reveal notable performance variations, highlighting the challenges introduced by finite-duration datasets and emphasizing the need for more rigorous statistical validation. By identifying these challenges, we aim to clarify the practical limitations of both ML-based and traditional detection systems and inform future benchmarking standards for GW searches.

  abstract: We present iHOMER, an iterative version of the HOMER method to extract Lund fragmentation functions from experimental data. Through iterations, we address the information gap between latent and observable phase spaces and systematically remove bias. To quantify uncertainties on the inferred weights, we use a combination of Bayesian neural networks and uncertainty-aware regression. We find that the combination of iterations and uncertainty quantification produces well-calibrated weights that accurately reproduce the data distribution. A parametric closure test shows that the iteratively learned fragmentation function is compatible with the true fragmentation function.

  abstract: \textit{What is the cosmological information content of a cubic Gigaparsec of dark matter? } Extracting cosmological information from the non-linear matter distribution has high potential to tighten parameter constraints in the era of next-generation surveys such as Euclid, DESI, and the Vera Rubin Observatory. Traditional approaches relying on summary statistics like the power spectrum and bispectrum, though analytically tractable, fail to capture the full non-Gaussian and non-linear structure of the density field. Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) provides a powerful alternative by learning directly from forward-modeled simulations. In this work, we apply SBI to the \textit{Quijote} dark matter simulations and introduce a hierarchical method that integrates small-scale information from field sub-volumes or \textit{patches} with large-scale statistics such as power spectrum and bispectrum. This hybrid strategy is efficient both computationally and in terms of the amount of training data required. It overcomes the memory limitations associated with full-field training. We show that our approach enhances Fisher information relative to analytical summaries and matches that of a very different approach (wavelet-based statistics), providing evidence that we are estimating the full information content of the dark matter density field at the resolution of $\sim 7.8~\mathrm{Mpc}/h$.

  abstract: Machine Learning (ML)-based unfolding methods have enabled high-dimensional and unbinned differential cross section measurements. While a suite of such methods has been proposed, most focus exclusively on the challenge of statistically removing resolution effects. In practice, unfolding methods must also account for impurities and finite acceptance and efficiency effects. In this paper, we extend a class of unfolding methods based on generative ML to include the full suite of effects relevant for cross section measurements. Our new methods include fully generative solutions as well as generative-discriminative hybrid approaches (GenFoldG and GenFoldC). We demonstrate these new techniques in both Gaussian and simulated LHC examples. Overall, we find that both methods are able to accommodate all effects, thus adding a complementary and analysis-ready method to the unfolding toolkit.

  abstract: "Precision measurements of neutron properties, like its permanent electric dipole moment, rely on understanding complex experimental setups in detail. We show how the properties of stored and transported ultracold neutron ensembles can be simulated reliably. In a second step, we illustrate how they can be used for simulation-based inference of the parameters associated with underlying physics processes such as neutron capture or beta decay. Our proof of principle for simulation-based inference confronts a longstanding challenge with ultracold neutrons: low measurement statistics coupled with a complex apparatus."

  abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is one of the essential steps to guarantee the convergence of machine learning models. We argue that intuition about the optimal choice of hyperparameters for stochastic gradient descent can be obtained by studying a neural network’s phase diagram, in which each phase is characterised by distinctive dynamics of the singular values of weight matrices. Taking inspiration from disordered systems, we start from the observation that the loss landscape of a multilayer neural network with mean squared error can be interpreted as a disordered system in feature space, where the learnt features are mapped to soft spin degrees of freedom, the initial variance of the weight matrices is interpreted as the strength of the disorder, and temperature is given by the ratio of the learning rate and the batch size. As the model is trained, three phases can be identified, in which the dynamics of weight matrices is qualitatively different. Employing a Langevin equation for stochastic gradient descent, previously derived using Dyson Brownian motion, we demonstrate that the three dynamical regimes can be classified effectively, providing practical guidance for the choice of hyperparameters of the optimiser.

  abstract: "Recently, the benefit of heavily overparameterized models has been observed in machine learning tasks: models with enough capacity to easily cross the \\emph{interpolation threshold} improve in generalization error compared to the classical bias-variance tradeoff regime. We demonstrate this behavior for the first time in particle physics data and explore when and where `double descent' appears and under which circumstances overparameterization results in a performance gain."

  abstract: Ultra-fast, precise, and controlled amplitude surrogates are essential for future LHC event generation. First, we investigate the noise reduction and biases of network ensembles and outline a new method to learn well-calibrated systematic uncertainties for them. We also establish evidential regression as a sampling-free method for uncertainty quantification. In a second part, we tackle localized disturbances for amplitude regression and demonstrate that learned uncertainties from Bayesian networks, ensembles, and evidential regression all identify numerical noise or gaps in the training data.

  abstract: A model-agnostic search for Beyond the Standard Model physics is presented, targeting final states with at least four light leptons (electrons or muons). The search regions are separated by event topology and unsupervised machine learning is used to identify anomalous events in the full 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data collected with the ATLAS detector during Run 2. No significant excess above the Standard Model background expectation is observed. Model-agnostic limits are presented in each topology, along with limits on several benchmark models including vector-like leptons, wino-like charginos and neutralinos, or smuons. Limits are set on the flavourful vector-like lepton model for the first time.

  abstract: We present a comparative study of Higgs event classification at the Large Hadron Collider that bypasses the traditional reconstruction chain. As a benchmark, we focus on distinguishing $t\bar{t}H$ from $t\bar{t}$ events with $H \to b\bar{b}$, a particularly challenging task due to their similar final-state topologies. Our pipeline begins with event generation in Pythia8, fast simulation with ACTS/Fatras, and classification directly from raw detector hits. We show for the first time that a transformer model originally developed for inner tracker hit-to-track assignment can be retrained to classify Higgs events directly from raw hits. For comparison, we reconstruct the same events with \texttt{Delphes} and train object-based classifiers, including multilayer perceptrons and the Particle Transformer. We evaluate both approaches under varying dataset sizes and pileup levels. Although Higgsformer works exclusively with inner tracker hits (i.e., without calorimeter or muon information), it achieves strong performance with an AUC value of 0.792.

  abstract: Gravitational waves from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), the inspirals of stellar-mass compact objects into massive black holes, are predicted to be observed by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). A sufficiently large number of EMRI observations will provide unique insights into the massive black hole population. We have developed a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework capable of constraining the parameters of the EMRI population, accounting for selection biases. We leverage the capacity of a feed-forward neural network as an emulator, enabling detectability calculations of $\sim10^5$ EMRIs in a fraction of a second, speeding up the likelihood evaluation by $\gtrsim6$ orders of magnitude. We validate our framework on a phenomenological EMRI population model. This framework enables studies of how well we can constrain EMRI population parameters, such as the slope of both the massive and stellar-mass black hole mass spectra and the branching fractions of different formation channels, allowing further investigation into the evolution of massive black holes.

  abstract: Magnetic hysteresis and eddy current decay continue to challenge beam quality and operational consistency in multi-cycling machines like the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN. Building on our previous work, this paper presents improvements in the data-driven approach for magnetic field modelling to enhance the reproducibility of SPS dipole and quadrupole fields and thus maintain stable beam parameters across all operational cycles. The method is based on feed-forward correction using magnetic field forecasting with machine learning. It now includes additional operational experience and demonstrates that the field error compensation can reliably be used in operation. This contribution proves that hysteresis compensation can be achieved without a feedback system based on expensive installations with online field measurements in reference magnets. The performance improvements achieved by eliminating the need for manual adjustments and reducing time- and energy-consuming accelerator pre-cycles are presented. The paper also sets the stage for future application in higher-order magnets, like sextupoles and octupoles, as well as on other CERN synchrotrons.

  abstract: The slow extracted beams at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) are transported over several 100 m long transfer lines to three targets in the CERN North Area Experimental Hall. The experiments need intensity fluctuations to be entirely eliminated over the roughly 5 s particle spill, requiring full debunching of the extracted beams. In this environment, secondary emission monitors (SEMs) have to replace the conventional beam position monitoring systems that rely on RF structure, with the intensity difference on split secondary emission foils used to indicate the beam position. Traditional trajectory correction algorithms however fail when the beam ends up on a single foil. This paper summarises successful first tests with reinforcement learning (RL) to learn to correct the trajectory based on foil intensity measurements. The RL agents were trained in simulation and then successfully transferred to the real accelerator environment. Results of the application of the trained RL agents for the alignment of moveable split foils in front of the targets will also be presented.

  abstract: At CERN’s Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR), high beam intensities are achieved through phase space painting with up to eight multi-turn injections from the linear accelerator Linac3. After each injection, the beam is cooled and stacked in longitudinal phase space using an electron cooler. During beam operation, key parameters such as RF cavity phases in the linac, the LEIR electron cooler gun voltage, and various magnetic field strengths along the transfer line must be frequently adjusted to compensate for the injection performance degradation occurring over time. The primary cause is the aging of the stripper foil, a thin carbon plate which strips off electrons from the passing ions, altering the energy of the beam injected from the linac. Time of flight measurements in the linac and Schottky signals in the ring provide the necessary diagnostics for correcting the performance degradation and can be encoded to provide a state for an optimizer. In this paper, we compare several data-driven methods, such as Bayesian Optimization and Reinforcement Learning for designing an autonomous controller to optimize and maintain injection performance during both beam commissioning and physics runs.

  abstract: The CERN accelerator complex relies critically on fast injection and extraction processes to transfer particle beams between accelerators via fast pulsed magnets, or kickers. Ensuring high availability is paramount, as the reliability of these systems directly impacts the large number of experiments conducted at CERN. In this paper, we propose to explore Continual Learning (CL) methods, specifically using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to develop an anomaly detection system for the fast kicker magnets. By continuously learning from evolving data while retaining prior knowledge, these models will be capable of detecting anomalies without the need for repeated retraining. This approach is particularly relevant for ensuring the reliability and stability of kicker magnets, where early anomaly detection is critical for preventing performance degradation.

  abstract: Particle accelerators like CLEAR (CERN Linear Accearator for research) are essential tools in advancing various scientific fields. Automating their operation to ensure stability and reproducibility is crucial for future large-scale projects. This paper explores the first steps toward autonomous control of the CLEAR beamline, focusing initially on beam steering and advancing to complex tasks like quadrupole alignment, vital for operational stability. Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents that adapt in real-time via beam screens measurements were trained and tested. The approach is optimized for sampling efficiency, addressing the high cost and invasiveness of data collection in accelerator environments. The method enables single-shot optimization for real operations, reducing the need for manual intervention. Results show that a few hours of training suffice for effective single-step corrections in the latter part of the CLEAR beamline, inspiring further development by the CLEAR research team.

  abstract: "We present R-ANODE, a new method for data-driven, model-agnostic resonant anomaly detection that raises the bar for both performance and interpretability. The key to R-ANODE is to enhance the inductive bias of the anomaly detection task by fitting a normalizing flow directly to the small and unknown signal component, while holding fixed a background model (also a normalizing flow) learned from sidebands. In\_doing so, R-ANODE is able to outperform all classifier-based, weakly supervised approaches as well as the previous ANODE method, which fit a density estimator to all of the data in the signal region instead of just the signal. We show that the method works equally well whether the unknown signal fraction is learned or fixed and is even robust to signal fraction misspecification. Finally, with the learned signal model, we can sample and gain qualitative insights into the underlying anomaly, which greatly enhances the interpretability of resonant anomaly detection and offers the possibility of simultaneously discovering and characterizing the new physics that could be hiding in the data."

  abstract: The components of the SIS100 synchrotron (FAIR facility) are presently under installation in the accelerator tunnel. The superconducting dipole magnets have been produced and the magnet field errors up to 7th order have been measured for all magnets. The superconducting quadrupole magnets are under production, the field error data for a part of the magnets is available. As a part of the magnet quality assessment, the particle tracking simulations are used to study the beam losses during the 1 sec beam accumulation at the injection energy. The tune settings for the slow extraction operation are considered. Direct space-charge effects and the Landau damping octupole magnets, which dominate the incoherent tune distribution, are included. In order to reduce the computational load and to increase the parameter resolution, a machine learning based optimizer is used in the accelerator and beam parameter studies.

  abstract: To construct a closed orbit model for an accelerator ring with intrinsic uncertainty quantification from orbit measurements, a physics-informed Gaussian Process model is proposed based on a stochastic ensemble of MAD-X lattices. Key advantages compared to LOCO (Linear Optics from Closed Orbits) include (1.) uncertainty-enabled orbit prediction in between BPMs (beam position monitors), (2.) fitting of a parameter distribution (dipole-like field errors) which inherently models uncertainty, (3.) incorporation of measurement uncertainty from BPM noise, and (4.) an active learning approach which can be more sample efficient than measuring an orbit response matrix. A case study is presented for the GSI heavy ion synchrotron SIS18 with various simulated applications, in particular constructing an effective machine model with minimal orbit uncertainty around the ring, and orbit correction to achieve minimal deviation at a specific location such as, e.g., the septum to control beam loss during slow extraction. This physics-inspired Gaussian Process regression approach shows potential to be applied to optics correction and further applications beyond closed orbit correction.

  abstract: "The Fair Universe project organised the HiggsML Uncertainty Challenge. This groundbreaking competition in high-energy physics (HEP) and machine learning was the first to strongly emphasise uncertainties, focusing on mastering both the uncertainties in the input training data and providing credible confidence intervals in the results. The challenge revolved around measuring the\_$(H \\rightarrow \\tau^+ \\tau^-)$\_cross-section, similar to the HiggsML challenge held on Kaggle in 2014, using a dataset representing the 4-momentum signal state. Participants were tasked with developing advanced analysis techniques to measure the signal strength and generate confidence intervals that included both statistical and systematic uncertainties. The accuracy of these intervals was automatically evaluated using pseudo-experiments to assess correct coverage. The dataset is now published in Zenodo, and the winning submissions are fully documented."

  abstract: The reconstruction of particle trajectories is a key challenge of particle physics experiments, as it directly impacts particle identification and physics performances. Additionally, it is one of the primary consumers of CPU resources in many high-energy physics experiments. As the luminosity of particle colliders increases, this reconstruction will become more complex and resource-intensive. Therefore, new algorithms are needed to address these challenges efficiently.During track reconstruction, more tracks are reconstructed than the actual truth particles due to fake tracks and redundant duplicates. This inefficiency is costly since each track requires individual reconstruction.We propose using a ranking-based machine learning algorithm to select track seeds before the actual track reconstruction occurs. By employing a DBSCAN clustering algorithm to group similar particle seeds and a Neural Network (NN) with a novel Margin Ranking Loss Function to score them, we can significantly reduce the number of tracks that need to be reconstructed, thereby speeding up the tracking process. This method has been implemented within the A Common Tracking Software framework and tested on the Open Data Detector, resulting in a twofold speedup with an efficiency reduction of only 0.2 percentage points.

  abstract: The upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) represents the next generation of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), offering a significantly enhanced sensitivity, up to five to ten times greater than existing instruments. Its first prototype, the Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1), is currently operational at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in La Palma, Spain. Deep learning techniques have shown promising results in reconstructing key physical properties of incident particles, such as energy, arrival direction, and particle classification, when applied to simulated data. While traditional techniques rely on simple parameterization of the shower image shape, deep learning can leverage the full temporal and charge information of the images, extracting additional information that is particularly valuable at the lowest energies (~20 GeV) accessible by LST-1. These insights are crucial for studying distant extragalactic sources, such as Active Galactic Nuclei, which can serve as probes for fundamental physics and cosmology. In this context, GammaLearn, a deep learning framework for IACTs data analysis, has demonstrated strong potential in this energy range (Vuillaume et al., 2021, ICRC).Here, we apply GammaLearn to observational data from LST-1 to assess its performance on real data.

  abstract: To maximize the amount of information extracted from cosmological datasets, simulations that accurately represent these observations are necessary. However, traditional simulations that evolve particles under gravity by estimating particle-particle interactions (<math display="inline"><mi>N</mi></math>-body simulations) are computationally expensive and prohibitive to scale to the large volumes and resolutions necessary for the upcoming datasets. Moreover, modeling the distribution of galaxies typically involves identifying virialized dark matter halos, which is also a time- and memory-consuming process for large <math display="inline"><mi>N</mi></math>-body simulations, further exacerbating the computational cost. In this study, we introduce CHARM, a novel method for creating mock halo catalogs by matching the spatial, mass, and velocity statistics of halos directly from the large-scale distribution of the dark matter density field. We develop multistage neural spline flow-based networks to learn this mapping at redshift <math display="inline"><mi>z</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.5</mn></math> directly with computationally cheaper low-resolution particle mesh simulations instead of relying on the high-resolution <math display="inline"><mi>N</mi></math>-body simulations. We show that the mock halo catalogs and painted galaxy catalogs have the same statistical properties as obtained from <math display="inline"><mi>N</mi></math>-body simulations in both real space and redshift space. Finally, we use these mock catalogs for cosmological inference using redshift-space galaxy power spectrum, bispectrum, and wavelet-based statistics using simulation-based inference, performing the first inference with accelerated forward model simulations and finding unbiased cosmological constraints with well-calibrated posteriors.
